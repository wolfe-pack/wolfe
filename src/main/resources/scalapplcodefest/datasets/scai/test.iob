### Urinary proteins in occupational exposure to chemicals and in diseases.
### Isoelectric focusing in thin-layer polyacrylamide gel is a method with high resolving power, e.g. for urinary proteins. Therefore more information can be obtained with this method than with ordinary electrophoresis. The present version of the method has a high capacity and allows study of up to 25 samples in parallel on each gel. Only a little more than one hour is required for separation. A sensitive staining procedure is used which allows detection of as little as 0.1 mug of protein in each zone. When effects on the kidney are present more than 20 different protein zones can sometimes be separated. Evaluation is made by densitometry as well as by comparison and classification of patterns. Urine samples have been studied from workers with varying exposure to cadmium lead and various chlorinated hydrocarbons, and patients with glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, nephrosis and mixed tubular and glomerular diseases. Typical tubular patterns, i.e. as developed in association with cadmium exposure were characterized by elevated excretion of beta1-microglobulin. Other types of kidney malfunction showed different features.

### Natural killer cell as the effector which mediates in vivo apoptosis in AK-5 tumor cells.
### AK-5 tumor cell death is mediated by natural killer cells through necrosis (perforin mediated) and apoptosis. Apoptosis is the mechanism which operates in immune animals in vivo. We have identified natural killer (NK) cell as the effector cell which induces apoptosis leading to tumor cell death in vivo. Naive NK cell which is unable to kill the AK-5 tumor cell can be activated with IL-2/IL-12 to make it capable of inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. NK cells from tumor-rejected animals show higher expression of Fas ligand and serine esterase granzyme B. In addition, NK cell-mediated apoptosis in AK-5 cells is totally abolished when effector cells are treated with anti-NKR-P1 mAb 3.2.3 and complement. NK cell-mediated apoptotic activity is inhibited in bcl-2 transfected tumor cells; however, the cytotoxic activity (perforin-mediated) remains unaffected. These observations suggest an important role for activated NK cells in inducing tumor cell death through necrosis (ADCC) and apoptosis leading to spontaneous regression of the AK-5 tumor in syngeneic animals.

### The effect of education of women and urbanization on actual and desired fertility and on fertility control in Lebanon.
### The influence of education of women and urbanization on actual and desired fertility and on fertility control in Lebanon was examined.  Data were used from 1 study conducted in the Nabatieh district of South Lebanon in the summer of 1976 and from a 2nd study conducted in 1970 in an area on the outskirts of the capital city of Beirut.  The total number of completed interviews in the Nabatieh sample was 1054.  This population consisted mostly of Shiites with Christian and Sunni minorities.  The urban sample consisted of 1545 Shiite and 1459 Maronite.  The examination revealed that: 1) among the rural sample, a relatively high level of education (beyond the primary level) is necessary to induce a substantial decrease in average children ever born;  2) a comparison of rural and urban samples showed the effect of the education variable was dependent on religious affiliation - the Shiite women at low levels of education demonstrated higher fertility than Maronite women, but they responded more to an improvement in education in the urban area;  3) women urban residents showed lower fertility than women rural dwellers, controlling for religion and age;  4) the rural study conducted 5 years after the urban study showed a lower level of desired fertility;  and 5) the Shiite women (who are a majority of the women in South Lebanon) revealed a tendency to use modern contraceptive methods, particularly the oral contraceptive, suggesting a receptivity in the area to the Lebanon Family Planning Associations project of Community Based Family Planning Services.

### 11271209
### Recurrence of hepatitis C virus after liver transplantation.
### The hepatitis C virus is a common cause of chronic hepatitis after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We evaluated 95 consecutive patients who underwent OLT at our institute between March 1988 and November 1992 and who had a follow-up period longer than 3 months. All patients had a second-generation test (ELISA + RIBA) for HCV antibodies (HCV Ab) before and monthly after OLT; all had a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for detection of viral RNA after the operation. Whenever biochemical abnormalities (hypertransaminasemia 2 times the normal range) were seen, a percutaneous liver biopsy was performed. Forty-two HCV Ab+ patients before OLT remained positive after OLT. In this group the PCR test was positive in 32 cases (78.5%). In 13/42 (30.9%) cases (all PCR+) with hypertransaminasemia histological examination showed signs of viral C hepatitis (score of Knodell minimum 3, maximum 12, median 5.5). Of 53 HCV Ab patients before OLT, only 1 became HCV Ab+ and PCR+ 15 months after OLT. In the remaining 52 patients 15 were PCR+. Twenty of 53 patients (37.7%) had a liver biopsy because of hypertransaminasemia: in no case did histology show any signs of hepatitis C. In conclusion, viral C recurs often after OLT for post-hepatitic C cirrhosis. The histological graft lesions are in most cases moderate. We did not observe any deaths related to viral C infection in grafted patients. According to our results post-hepatic C cirrhosis remains a good indication for OLT.

### [Evaluation of the morphology of the human placental cotyledon following dual in vitro perfusion in variable magnetic field]
### Objectives and the aim of the study was electron-microscopy morphological estimation of the human placental cotyledon after 180 minutes of dual closed perfusion in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the experimental group the cotyledons were exposed to variable magnetic field of 2 mT magnetic induction and 50 Hz frequency. The control group K (10 perfusions) was not subjected to magnetic field while the experimental group B (10 perfusions) was influenced by magnetic field. RESULTS: It was found that homogeneous variable magnetic field disturbs the ultrastructure of the nuclei and cytoplasma and it increases the density of the vascular-epithelial membrane of villi cells of human placenta in vitro. CONCLUSION: Variable sinusoildal, magnetic field of 2 mT magnetic induction and 50 Hz frequency disturbs the ultrastructure of the nuclei and cytoplasma and it increases the density of the vascular-epithelial membrane of villi cells of human placenta in vitro after 180 minutes of dual closed perfusion in vitro.

### Methods of adjustment for estimating the attributable risk in case-control studies: a review.
### In the 1980's, progress was made in adjusting estimates of the attributable risk (AR) for confounding factors and in calculating associated confidence intervals. In this paper, methods of adjustment for estimation of the AR in case-control studies are reviewed. The limitations and problems associated with two methods based on stratification, the weighted-sum approach and the Mantel-Haenszel approach, are discussed. They include small-sample bias with the weighted-sum approach and the difficulty of taking interaction into account with the Mantel-Haenszel approach. A third method based on logistic regression is reviewed. It is argued that this latter method has the greatest generality and flexibility, and includes the two other approaches as special cases. Throughout the paper, an example of a case-control study of oesophageal cancer illustrates the use of the methods described.

### 11952041
### T-cell-mediated immunity in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.
### Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is considered to be an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the extraocular muscles and the orbital fat/connective tissue. Recent studies analyzing T cells infiltrating retrobulbar tissues generated important insights into the immunopathogenesis of TAO. The present review focuses on advances in our understanding of mechanisms responsible for the autoimmune inflammation in TAO, especially T cell migration to the inflammatory site, T cell activation by autoantigens and costimulatory signals and their cytokine profile. The elucidation of these processes might lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies directed against autoreactive T cells.

### 16965980
### Brain arterioles show more active vesicular transport of blood-borne tracer molecules than capillaries and venules after focused ultrasound-evoked opening of the blood-brain barrier.
### Previously, activation of vesicular transport in the brain microvasculature was shown to be one of the mechanisms of focused ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening. In the present study, we aimed to estimate the rate of the transendothelial vesicular traffic after focused ultrasound sonication in the rabbit brain, using ultrastructural morphometry and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a tracer. In the capillaries, the mean endothelial pinocytotic densities (the number of HRP-containing vesicles per microm(2) of the cell cytoplasm) were 0.9 and 1.05 vesicles/microm(2) 1 h after sonication with ultrasound frequencies of 0.69 and 0.26 MHz, respectively. In the arterioles, these densities were 1.63 and 2.43 vesicles/microm(2), values 1.8 and 2.3 times higher. In control locations, the densities were 0.7 and 0.14 vesicles/microm(2) for capillaries and arterioles, respectively. A small number of HRP-positive vesicles were observed in the venules. Focal delivery of HRP tracer was also observed in light microscopy. The results indicate that the precapillary microvessels play an important role in macromolecular transcytoplasmic traffic through the ultrasound-induced BBB modulation, which should be considered in the future development of trans-BBB drug delivery strategies.

### 11667955
### Anti-cytokine therapy in fibrosing alveolitis: where are we now?
### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a condition that has a poor prognosis, with a median survival of 4-5 years irrespective of treatment. Ziesche et al (N Engl J Med 1999, 341: 1264-1269) describe an open randomised trial of 18 patients with IPF, unresponsive to corticosteroid treatment at high dose. Nine patients were treated with continued corticosteroid and nine with prednisolone plus interferon-gamma 1b (IFN-gamma). Significant benefits in physiological parameters are reported in the IFN-gamma-treated group. An analysis of lung tissue by reverse-transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction showed corresponding decreases in the transcription of transforming growth factor-beta1 and connective tissue growth factor. This is the first report of treatment showing efficacy in this disease, albeit in a very preliminary study, but the data should be viewed with caution. This study is discussed in the context of other published studies of treatment for IPF and the scientific rationale on which it was based.

### 3013872
### Eukaryotic DNA diverges at a long and complex pyrimidine.purine tract that can adopt altered conformations.
### A domain exhibiting major sequence divergences among three cloned repeat units of a complex satellite DNA of the Bermuda land crab contains a repetitive polypyrimidine.polypurine segment consisting of a long C.G tract embedded between runs of CCT.AGG and CGCAC.GTGCG and their variations. The domain adopts at least two types of altered conformations that are markedly affected by pH and negative superhelical density; only one is sensitive to ionic strength. Supercoil-dependent distortions in helical structure are most pronounced at points of interruption in compositional bias in this domain and a similar although less extensive, divergent domain nearby. Since the domain is the site of major sequence divergences among individual satellite repeat units, the altered conformations may be involved in site-specific recombination between repeat units, either those arranged in tandem or those scattered throughout the genome.

### [Clinical study of S 6472 granule preparation (sustained-release cefaclor) in chronic respiratory airway infections]
### S 6472 granule preparation, a sustained-release preparation of cefaclor, was administered to 21 patients with chronic respiratory airway infections for its clinical study; a daily dosage between 750 and 1,500 mg was orally given in 2 divided doses after breakfast and dinner for a duration of 3 to 14 days. Clinical effects were good in 15 cases, fair in 1 case, poor in 4 cases and unknown in 1 case. No side effects were observed except for a case of impaired appetite. There appeared to be no abnormal laboratory test valued due to the drug.

### 2536771
### Lipopolysaccharide-induced gene expression in murine peritoneal macrophages is selectively suppressed by agents that elevate intracellular cAMP.
### Elevation of intracellular cAMP has been associated with the suppression of macrophage activation. The present study has examined the effects of agents that alter intracellular levels of cAMP on LPS-induced macrophage gene expression. Treatment of murine peritoneal macrophages with trace amounts of LPS leads to dramatically enhanced expression of multiple mRNA including the competence genes JE and KC, first observed in platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated fibroblasts, and those encoding the inflammatory monokines IL-1 and TNF. If macrophages are first treated with cholera toxin or dibutyryl cAMP 15 min before stimulation with LPS, the accumulation of mRNA encoding both JE and TNF is strongly suppressed whereas mRNA levels for KC and IL-1 are unaffected. The suppression of JE and TNF mRNA levels is dose dependent, in the range of 10 to 500 microM dibutyryl cAMP; concentrations as high as 1 mM do not affect the expression of either KC or IL-1. When dibutyryl cAMP is added to macrophages after initiation of LPS treatment, suppressive effects are diminished in a time-dependent fashion. Furthermore, dibutyryl cAMP suppresses the LPS-induced transcriptional activation of the TNF gene. Previous work has shown that the LPS-induced expression of JE appears to be mediated by hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides and involves a post-transcriptional mechanism. Treatment with dibutyryl cAMP suppresses JE expression induced by treatment with phorbol ester and A23187 suggesting that inhibition of gene expression must act at a site other than the initial transmembrane signaling event. Finally, dibutyryl cAMP only marginally affects the constitutive transcription of the JE gene indicating that suppression may involve a post-transcriptional mechanism. These results indicate that expression of genes encoding inducible early proteins and inflammatory monokines are selectively regulated by elevation of intracellular cAMP. Such effects may be pleiotropic in nature involving multiple molecular mechanisms.

### Quality and customers: Type 2 change in mental health delivery within health care reform.
### The traditional separation of mental health and medical programs is problematic because mental health issues are inseparable from the larger medical system. By contrast, a collaborative primary care model of mental health care, augmented and supported by secondary specialty mental health services, has the potential to optimize quality and cost goals while reinforcing health care reform principles. The flexibility of mental health treatment in this delivery structure provides opportunities to customize services according to patient and purchaser expectations.

### Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome according to different diagnostic criteria in a non-selected adult population.
### BACKGROUND: Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome shows great variation among epidemiological studies, which may be due to different diagnostic criteria. AIM: To assess prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome according to various diagnostic criteria and to study differences in symptom severity, psychopathology, and use of health care resources between subjects fulfilling different diagnostic criteria. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to 5000 randomly selected adults. Presence of irritable bowel syndrome was assessed by four diagnostic criteria: Manning 2 (at least two Manning symptoms), Manning 3 (at least three Manning symptoms), Rome I and Rome II. RESULTS: Response rate was 73%. Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome by Manning 2, Manning 3, Rome I and Rome II criteria was 16.2%, 9.7%, 5.6%, and 5.1% respectively. Of those fulfilling Rome II criteria, 97% fulfilled Manning 2. Severe or very severe abdominal pain was reported by 27-30% of Manning-positive subjects, and 44% of Rome-positives. Prevalence of depression in Manning 2, and Rome II groups was 30.6 and 39.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome by Rome II criteria is considerably lower than by Manning criteria. Subjects fulfilling Rome criteria form a subgroup of Manning-positive subjects with more severe abdominal symptoms, more psychopathology, and more frequent use of the health care system.

### Overview of clinical experiences on carbon ion radiotherapy at NIRS.
### BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carbon ion beams provide physical and biological advantages over photons. This study summarizes the experiences of carbon ion radiotherapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 1994 and August 2003, a total of 1601 patients with various types of malignant tumors were enrolled in phase I/II dose-escalation studies and clinical phase II studies. All but malignant glioma patients received carbon ion radiotherapy alone with a fraction number and overall treatment time being fixed for each tumor site, given to one field per day and 3 or 4 days per week. In dose-escalation studies, the total dose was escalated by 5 or 10% increments to ensure a safe patient treatment and to determine appropriate dose levels. RESULTS: In the initial dose-escalation studies, severe late complications of the recto-sigmoid colon and esophagus were observed in those patients who received high dose levels for prostate, uterine cervix and esophageal cancer. Such adverse effects, however, did shortly disappear as a result of determining safe dose levels and because of improvements in the irradiation method. Carbon ion radiotherapy has shown improvement of outcome for tumor entities: (a) locally advanced head and neck tumors, in particular those with non-squamous cell histology including adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and malignant melanoma; (b) early stage NSCLC and locally advanced NSCLC; (c) locally advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for surgical resection; (d) locally advanced hepatocellular carcinomas; (e) locally advanced prostate carcinomas, in particular for high-risk patients; (f) chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base and cervical spine, and (g) post-operative pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer. Treatment of malignant gliomas, pancreatic, uterine cervix, and esophageal cancer is being investigated within dose-escalation studies. There is a rationale for the use of short-course RT regimen due to the superior dose localization and the unique biological properties of high-LET beams. This has been proven in treatment of NSCLC and hepatoma, where the fraction number has been successfully reduced to 4-12 fractions delivered within 1-3 weeks. Even for other types of tumors including prostate cancer, bone/soft tissue sarcoma and head/neck tumors, it was equally possible to apply the therapy in much shorter treatment times as compared to conventional RT regimen. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy, due to its physical and biologic advantages over photons, has provided improved outcome in terms of minimized toxicity and high local control rates for locally advanced tumors and pathologically non-squamous cell type of tumors. Using carbon ion radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy with application of larger doses per fraction and a reduction of overall treatment times as compared to conventional radiotherapy was enabled.

### 4026277
### The relationship of attitudes and experiences of Finnish youths to their hedonic responses to sweetness in soft drinks.
### Attitudes to sugar and previous experience (liking and use at present and in childhood) of sweet foods as well as hedonic responses to two levels of sweetness in soft drinks were determined in a young adult population (112 males, 112 females). Females were more negative in their attitudes but they reported greater liking of sweet foods. Sugar attitudes were not related to hedonic responses to normal sweetness (9%) in either sex group, but in the case of lower sweetness (5%) negative attitudes increased along with the rated pleasantness, particularly among males. Reported liking and use of soft drinks had some significant correlations with hedonic responses to both sweetness levels, but experiences of other sweet foods were not related to the hedonic responses to sweetness in soft drinks.

### 9153571
### Photoreceptor cells of the pike pineal organ as cellular circadian oscillators.
### In the pike pineal, the rhythm of melatonin (MEL) secretion is driven by a population of cellular circadian oscillators, synchronized by the 24 h light/dark (LD) cycle. Because the pineal photoreceptor contains both the input and output pathways of the clock, this cell is likely to be a cellular circadian system by itself. To support this idea, we have dissociated and cultured pike pineal cells as well as purified photoreceptors. In culture, the pineal cells reassociated in follicles, surrounded by collagen fibres. At the electron microscopic level, they appeared well preserved. Total cells consisted mainly of photoreceptors and glia. Purified cells corresponded exclusively to photoreceptors. Under LD, MEL production was rhythmic. Under constant darkness (DD), the rhythm was well sustained for at least six 24 h cycles (tau = 24/27 h) with 1 x 10(6) total cells/well or below; with 2 x 10(6) total cells/well, a strong damping occurred towards high levels as soon as after the second cycle. At the density of 0.5 x 10(6) cells/well, purified photoreceptors produced less MEL than an equivalent amount of total cells. However, the pattern of the oscillations was similar to that observed with 2 x 10(6) total cells, i.e. a damping occurred rapidly. Decreasing the density to 0.125 x 10(6) photoreceptors/well resulted in a loss of homogeneity among replicates. The production of melatonin by single photoreceptors was monitored by means of the reverse haemolytic plaque assay. Both under LD and under DD, the number of photoreceptors releasing melatonin was higher during the (subjective) dark than during the (subjective) light. The results provide strong support to the idea that the pike pineal photoreceptor is a cellular circadian system. Expression of the oscillations seemed to depend on several factors, including cell to cell contacts between photoreceptors. There is indication that also MEL and glia might be involved.

### 1736313
### Preservation of metabolic activity in lyophilized human erythrocytes.
### Normal human erythrocytes (RBC) were freeze-dried under conditions that caused minimal modification in normal RBC metabolic activities. Because of the known effects of long-term storage on metabolic activities, we studied the effects of our lyophilization process on RBC metabolism. Of all the metabolic enzymes studied, only triosephosphate isomerase (D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.1), enolase (2-phospho-D-glyceratehydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.11), and pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate O2-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) were decreased when compared with fresh control nonlyophilized RBC. The activities of these enzymes did not differ significantly from those of blood bank RBC. Concentrations of high-energy intermediates, ATP, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, along with lactate and ATP production were decreased in lyophilized RBC. No enzymes of the pentose phosphate shunt were altered during lyophilization. In addition, our data show that lyophilized RBC possess an intact capacity to (i) synthesize adenine nucleotides and (ii) reduce MetHb to Hb and, thus, maintain the Hb in a functional physiologic state similar to fresh nonlyophilized RBC. The present study demonstrates the possibility of lyophilizing RBC in a manner that maintains normal metabolic and enzymatic function upon rehydration.

### Regional cerebral blood flow during temporal lobe seizures associated with ictal vomiting: an ictal SPECT study in two patients.
### PURPOSE: Ictal vomiting represents a rare clinical manifestation during seizures originating from the temporal lobes of the nondominant hemisphere. The precise anatomic structures responsible for generation of ictal vomiting remain to be clarified. Ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), which allows one to visualize the three-dimensional dynamic changes of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) associated with the ongoing epileptic activity, should be useful to study the brain areas activated during ictal vomiting. METHODS: We performed ictal Tc-HMPAO SPECT scans in two patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) whose seizures were characterized by ictal retching and vomiting. MTLE was documented by typical clinical seizure semiology, interictal and ictal EEG findings, hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and a seizure-free outcome after selective amydalohippocampectomy. In both patients, seizures originated in the nondominant temporal lobe. We obtained accurate anatomic reference of rCBF changes visible on SPECT by a special coregistration technique of MRI and SPECT. We used ictal SPECT studies in 10 patients with MTLE who had seizures without ictal vomiting as controls. RESULTS: In the two patients with ictal vomiting, we found a significant hyperperfusion of the nondominant temporal lobe (inferior, medial, and lateral superior) and of the occipital region on ictal SPECT. In patients without ictal vomiting, on the contrary, these brain regions never were hyperperfused simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Ictal SPECT provides further evidence that activation of a complex cortical network, including the medial and lateral superior aspects of the temporal lobe, and maybe the occipital lobes, is responsible for the generation of ictal vomiting.

### 16573837
### Early detection of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in Chagas' disease.
### BACKGROUND: Chagas' disease may cause left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and its early detection in asymptomatic patients would allow to stratify the risk and to optimize medical treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate if transmitral Doppler flow can detect early abnormalities of the diastolic left ventricular function in patients during the indeterminate phase of Chagas' disease, in which the electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray and 2-D echocardiogram (2D-echo) are normal. METHODS: a group of 54 patients with Chagas' disease was studied and compared to a control group of 27 subjects of similar age. All were assessed with an ECG, chest X-ray, 2-D echo, and transmitral Doppler flow. RESULTS: both groups had similar values in the 2D-echo. In patients with Chagas' disease, the transmitral Doppler showed a higher peak A velocity (control group: 0.44 m/sec, Chagas group: 0.55 m/sec, p = 0.001), a lower E/A ratio (control group: 1.45, Chagas group: 1.22, p < 0.05), and a lengthening of the deceleration time of early diastolic filling (control: 138.7 +/- 26.8 msec, Chagas group: 167.9 +/- 34.6 msec, p = 001), thus revealing an early disorder of the diastolic left ventricular function in patients with Chagas' disease. CONCLUSION: in patients with Chagas' disease who are in the indeterminate phase, transmitral Doppler flow allowed to identify early abnormalities of the left ventricular diastolic function, which provide useful clinical information for prognostic stratification and treatment.

### 8713055
### Multiple steps in the regulation of transcription-factor level and activity.
### This review focuses on the regulation of transcription factors, many of which are DNA-binding proteins that recognize cis-regulatory elements of target genes and are the most direct regulators of gene transcription. Transcription factors serve as integration centres of the different signal-transduction pathways affecting a given gene. It is obvious that the regulation of these regulators themselves is of crucial importance for differential gene expression during development and in terminally differentiated cells. Transcription factors can be regulated at two, principally different, levels, namely concentration and activity, each of which can be modulated in a variety of ways. The concentrations of transcription factors, as of intracellular proteins in general, may be regulated at any of the steps leading from DNA to protein, including transcription, RNA processing, mRNA degradation and translation. The activity of a transcription factor is often regulated by (de) phosphorylation, which may affect different functions, e.g. nuclear localization DNA binding and trans-activation. Ligand binding is another mode of transcription-factor activation. It is typical for the large super-family of nuclear hormone receptors. Heterodimerization between transcription factors adds another dimension to the regulatory diversity and signal integration. Finally, non-DNA-binding (accessory) factors may mediate a diverse range of functions, e.g. serving as a bridge between the transcription factor and the basal transcription machinery, stabilizing the DNA-binding complex or changing the specificity of the target sequence recognition. The present review presents an overview of different modes of transcription-factor regulation, each illustrated by typical examples.

### 847633
### Cerebral Ischemia during carotid endarterectomy with severe but reversible changes.
### Electroencephalographic monitoring of a patient during carotid endarterectomy demonstrated severe ipsilateral voltage suppression with preservation of rhythms when the common carotid artery was clamped. Because the atheromatous plaque extended almost to the base of the skull, it was impossible to insert a shunt. Occlusion time was 19 minutes. After carotid flow was re-established, there was a rapid recovery of voltage. The patient awoke with a profound hemiparesis, but this cleared almost completely within a week. The EEG changes indicated severe ischemia, but, though function was transiently impaired, there was no apparent cerebral necrosis. This case represents the most severe yet reversible episode of ischemia during carotid clamping reported to date. Preservation of EEG rhythms, even in the face of voltage suppression, may have been a favorable sign.

### Overview of clinical experiences on carbon ion radiotherapy at NIRS.
### BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carbon ion beams provide physical and biological advantages over photons. This study summarizes the experiences of carbon ion radiotherapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 1994 and August 2003, a total of 1601 patients with various types of malignant tumors were enrolled in phase I/II dose-escalation studies and clinical phase II studies. All but malignant glioma patients received carbon ion radiotherapy alone with a fraction number and overall treatment time being fixed for each tumor site, given to one field per day and 3 or 4 days per week. In dose-escalation studies, the total dose was escalated by 5 or 10% increments to ensure a safe patient treatment and to determine appropriate dose levels. RESULTS: In the initial dose-escalation studies, severe late complications of the recto-sigmoid colon and esophagus were observed in those patients who received high dose levels for prostate, uterine cervix and esophageal cancer. Such adverse effects, however, did shortly disappear as a result of determining safe dose levels and because of improvements in the irradiation method. Carbon ion radiotherapy has shown improvement of outcome for tumor entities: (a) locally advanced head and neck tumors, in particular those with non-squamous cell histology including adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and malignant melanoma; (b) early stage NSCLC and locally advanced NSCLC; (c) locally advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for surgical resection; (d) locally advanced hepatocellular carcinomas; (e) locally advanced prostate carcinomas, in particular for high-risk patients; (f) chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base and cervical spine, and (g) post-operative pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer. Treatment of malignant gliomas, pancreatic, uterine cervix, and esophageal cancer is being investigated within dose-escalation studies. There is a rationale for the use of short-course RT regimen due to the superior dose localization and the unique biological properties of high-LET beams. This has been proven in treatment of NSCLC and hepatoma, where the fraction number has been successfully reduced to 4-12 fractions delivered within 1-3 weeks. Even for other types of tumors including prostate cancer, bone/soft tissue sarcoma and head/neck tumors, it was equally possible to apply the therapy in much shorter treatment times as compared to conventional RT regimen. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy, due to its physical and biologic advantages over photons, has provided improved outcome in terms of minimized toxicity and high local control rates for locally advanced tumors and pathologically non-squamous cell type of tumors. Using carbon ion radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy with application of larger doses per fraction and a reduction of overall treatment times as compared to conventional radiotherapy was enabled.

### 3866758
### Hereditary motor neuropathy, distal type: electrophysiological and pathological studies of a case.
### A case of HMN, distal type transmitted as autosomal dominant is described. Clinical findings appear to be consistent with a peroneal muscular atrophy, indistinguishable from HMSN types I and II. The electrophysiological data reveal a pathological involvement of the anterior horns, whereas sensory and motor conduction are normal. A muscle biopsy showed neurogenic atrophy, while the morphology of the sural nerve was normal.

### 16162265
### Regulation of immune cell adhesion and migration by regulator of adhesion and cell polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues.
### Rap1 has emerged as an important regulator of adhesion in multicellular organisms. In the immune system, Rap1 functions as an inside-out signalling molecule for leucocyte integrins following stimulation with chemokines or antigens. Regulator of adhesion and cell polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues (RAPL) is a novel Rap1 effector molecule that mediates Rap1 signalling to integrins. The Rap1-RAPL complex regulates the spatial distribution of the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 as well as cell polarization. The linking of inside-out signalling with polarization synergistically promotes highly efficient lymphocyte trafficking. Targeted deletion of RAPL in mice has demonstrated multiple indispensable roles for this protein in lymphocyte and dendritic cell trafficking critical for immunosurveillance.

### 264115
### Changes in thick filament length in Limulus striated muscle.
### Here we describe the change in thick filament length in striated muscle of Limulus, the horseshoe crab. Long thick filaments (4.0 microns) are isolated from living, unstimulated Limulus striated muscle while those isolated from either electrically or K+-stimulated fibers are significantly shorter (3.1 microns) (P less than 0.001). Filaments isolated from muscle glycerinated at long sarcomere lengths are long (4.4 microns) while those isolated from muscle glycerinated at short sarcomere lengths are short (2.9 microns) and the difference is significant (P less than 0.001). Thin filaments are 2.4 microns in length. The shortening of thick filaments is related to the wide range of sarcomere lengths exhibited by Limulus telson striated muscle.

### 9789730
### Apoptosis detection: an overview.
### As the analysis of apoptosis is of interest in many basic and clinically oriented investigations, we intend to give a brief overview on the recently most-used methods for detection of apoptotic cells, including the study of morphology, analysis of DNA degradation, DNA end-labeling techniques, flow cytometric analysis, and nuclease assays. Features and advantages of the different methods are discussed.

### 17180529
### Early relapse in multiple sclerosis-associated optic neuritis following the use of interferon beta-1a in Chinese patients.
### PURPOSE: The incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) is relatively rare in Chinese. The beneficial effect of interferon beta-1a in modifying the disease course of MS has been rarely analyzed in Chinese patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical response to interferon beta1-a in Chinese patients with MS-associated optic neuritis (ON). METHODS: A retrospective case control study was conducted in 20 MS patients with optic nerve involvement. The interferon (IF) group comprised ten patients receiving interferon beta-1a. The noninterferon (NIF) group comprised another ten MS patients with optic nerve involvement who did not receive interferon treatment. The clinical characteristics, laboratory data, management, and disease course were retrospectively analyzed. The main outcomes of the study were the annualized relapse rate (ARR) for MS, and final visual outcome data. RESULTS: The ARR did not differ between the pretreatment period and the posttreatment period within the IF group. There was also no significant decrease of ARR in the IF group when compared with the NIF group. However, we observed an early recurrence of ON in 50% of the IF cases following the use of interferon beta-1a. The final visual outcome did not differ between the IF group and the NIF group. CONCLUSIONS: The use of interferon beta-1a should be carefully monitored because early relapse of ON may complicate the treatment course in this patient group.

### 10798706
### A fast fixed-point algorithm for independent component analysis of complex valued signals.
### Separation of complex valued signals is a frequently arising problem in signal processing. For example, separation of convolutively mixed source signals involves computations on complex valued signals. In this article, it is assumed that the original, complex valued source signals are mutually statistically independent, and the problem is solved by the independent component analysis (ICA) model. ICA is a statistical method for transforming an observed multidimensional random vector into components that are mutually as independent as possible. In this article, a fast fixed-point type algorithm that is capable of separating complex valued, linearly mixed source signals is presented and its computational efficiency is shown by simulations. Also, the local consistency of the estimator given by the algorithm is proved.

### 1454903
### A theory of humor elicitation.
### This article presents a general theory of humor elicitation that specifies the conditions in which humor is experienced in both social and nonsocial situations. The theory takes into account the interpretation of a stimulus event that is necessary to elicit humor, the difficulty of identifying the humor-eliciting features of this interpretation, and the cognitive elaboration of implications of the event. The influence of these factors is postulated to depend on subjects' information-processing objectives at the time a stimulus event occurs. The theory is used to conceptualize the humor elicited by jokes, witticisms, and social events that are neither intended nor expected to be humorous. Particular attention is given to the cognitive underpinnings of responses to ethnic humor and to the humor that is elicited by one's own behavior in social situations.

### 12797455
### Evaluation of infant methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genotype, maternal vitamin use, and risk of high versus low level spina bifida defects.
### BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested that homozygosity for the C677T 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) variant is a potential risk factor for neural tube defects (NTDs), as individuals homozygous for the C677T allele have slightly elevated homocysteine concentrations under conditions of low folic acid intake. It has been hypothesized that maternal folic acid supplementation prevents NTDs by partially correcting reduced MTHFR activity associated with the variant form of the enzyme. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from newborn screening blood spots obtained from 145 infants with spina bifida (SB) and 260 nonmalformed control infants. The MTHFR C677T genotype was determined by restriction enzyme digestion of PCR amplification products with Hinf1. We investigated whether infant MTHFR genotype influenced the risk for the anatomic level of the SB lesion (high vs. low); we also explored whether maternal vitamin use influenced this risk. RESULTS: Compared to controls, the frequency of SB infants with the homozygous 677 TT genotype was greatest in those infants with high level SB defects (26%; odds ratio [OR] = 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.9-10.1) than for those with low level SB defects (22%; OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 0.9-3.2). Furthermore, homozygous 677TT infants whose mothers did not use vitamins containing folic acid had a modestly increased risk of SB (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 0.8-3.9), with this risk increasing more than three-fold (OR = 5.5; 95% CI = 0.8-28.1) for those infants with high level SB defects whose mothers did not use vitamins. CONCLUSIONS: Based upon our observations, it is suggested that the association between the infant MTHFR homozygous variant genotype and spina bifida risk may be conditional upon both lesion level and maternal vitamin use.

### 1786056
### Xenotransplantation of microencapsulated pancreatic islets contained in a vascular prosthesis: preliminary results.
### Porcine and human pancreatic islets were microencapsulated in an alginate-polylysine biomembrane and put in a chamber of a new vascular prosthesis composed of an inner tubing of Dacron mesh and an outer tubing of expanded polytetrafluorethylene material. The vascular prosthesis was anastomized between the iliac artery and the contralateral vein of diabetic dogs. The recipients did not receive any immunosuppressive therapy. Function of porcine and human islets was monitored by measuring serum glucose levels and human C-peptide concentrations. After transplantation, serum glucose levels were maintained at values lower than 200 mg/dl, and C-peptide concentrations were between 0.8 and 3.2 ng/ml. Injected insulin requirements decreased by 50%-60%. Four to 8 weeks after transplantation, histologic examination showed well-preserved and functioning islets in the majority of intact microcapsules. Fibrin and inflammatory cells were not observed in the chamber. These data suggest long-term survival and function of microencapsulated pancreatic islets in the vascular prosthesis.

### 8164839
### Levodopa peak response time reflects severity of dopamine neuron loss in Parkinson's disease.
### We measured the time to peak antiparkinson response following injection of levodopa or apomorphine in 57 patients with Parkinson's disease. The peak response time for levodopa fell from 53 +/- 6.5 minutes in patients at Hoehn and Yahr stage I-II, and 28 +/- 4.8 minutes in those at stage IV (p < 0.0005). There was a significant correlation between levodopa peak response time and symptom duration (r = 0.65; p < 0.0001), but there was no relation between apomorphine peak response time and measures of disease severity. Peak response time to levodopa appears to reflect predominantly the status of compensatory presynaptic dopaminergic mechanisms and thus may provide an index to the degree of dopamine neuron degeneration in parkinsonian patients.

### 17145433
### Age-related variations of varicose veins anatomy.
### BACKGROUND: Primary varicose veins are commonly considered a progressive disease starting from the saphenous junctions and extending to tributaries in a retrograde fashion along the saphenous trunks. This theory has been criticized by studies indicating different patterns of development and progression of varicose veins. To contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, the anatomy of the venous bed was comparatively evaluated by duplex sonography in patients with varicose veins with a marked difference in age. METHODS: The study included 100 varicose limbs in 82 patients aged < 30 years and 238 limbs in 183 patients aged > 60 years. Veins were designated as saphenous veins (SVs), tributaries of the SVs (STVs), and veins not connected with the SVs (NSVs). Four main anatomic patterns were comparatively evaluated: (1) varicose changes only along SVs, (2) varicose changes along SVs and STVs, (3) varicose changes only in STVs, and (4) varicose changes only in NSVs. RESULTS: SVs were normal in 44% of varicose limbs. In most limbs from young subjects, varicose changes afflicted only SVTs (25%) and NSVs (36%). Varicose SVs were more frequent in the older group (62%) than in younger one (39%) owing to a higher prevalence of limbs with combined SV and STV varicosities (respectively, 59% and 37%). In the older group, varicosities in the STVs were more frequently observed in association with incompetence of the SV trunks. CONCLUSION: The frequent occurrence of normal SVs in varicose limbs of all patients does not support the crucial role commonly credited to SVs in the pathogenesis of primary varicosities. Moreover, the SV trunks were normal in most varicose limbs from young patients. These findings suggest that varicose disease may progressively extend in an antegrade fashion, spreading from the STVs to the SVs. This hypothesis suggests that the saphenous trunks could be spared in the treatment of a relevant number of varicose legs. Prospective longitudinal studies with serial duplex evaluations of large series of extremities are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

### 12108547
### Glutathione S-transferase of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum: characterization of a potential drug target.
### Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which occur abundantly in most organisms, are essentially involved in the intracellular detoxification of numerous substances including chemotherapeutic agents, and thus play a major role in the development of drug resistance. A gene encoding a protein with sequence identity of up to 37% with known GSTs was identified on chromosome 14 of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. It was amplified using gametocyte cDNA and expressed in Escherichia coli as a hexahistidyl-tagged protein of 26 kDa subunit size. The homodimeric enzyme (PfGST) was found to catalyse the glutathione (GSH)-dependent modification of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and other typical GST substrates such as o-nitrophenyl acetate, ethacrynic acid, and cumene hydroperoxide. The Km value for GSH was 164+/-20 microM. PfGST was inhibited by cibacron blue (Ki=0.5 microM), S-hexylglutathione (Ki=35 microM), and protoporphyrin IX (Ki=10 microM). Hemin, a most toxic compound for parasitised erythrocytes, was found to be an uncompetitive ligand of PfGST with a Ki of 6.5 microM. Based on the activity of PfGST in extracts of P. falciparum, the enzyme represents 1 to 10% of cellular protein and might therefore serve as an efficient in vivo buffer for parasitotoxic hemin. Destabilising ligands of GST are thus expected to be synergistic with the antimalarial drug chloroquine, which itself was found to be a very weak inhibitor of PfGST (IC50>200 microM). X-ray quality crystals of PfGST (250x200x50 microm) will serve as starting point for structure-based drug design.

### The effects of oral clonidine on the growth hormone level in acromegalic patients.
### The effects of the noradrenergic agent clonidine on GH secretion of the adenohypophysis were studied in 10 healthy volunteers and 11 acromegalic patients. Orally administered clonidine led to a considerable serum human growth hormone (GH) level increase in the healthy individuals. In the acromegalic patients the clonidine resulted in a slight, but not significant GH increase. These results support the findings that the mechanism of noradrenergic regulation of serum GH secretion is impaired in acromegaly.

### [Keratoplasty of pseudophakic eyes with posterior chamber lenses in Fuchs' dystrophy and secondary bullous keratopathy. Long-term outcome]
### Penetrating keratoplasties in pseudophakia were added to a group with limited prognosis. This was especially valuable, if iris-supported and anterior chamber intraocular lenses were implanted. Since today mainly posterior chamber lenses are implanted, the question of the long-term prognosis in this type of lens is important. PATIENTS AND METHOD: From 1985 to 1994, 62 penetrating keratoplasties in pseudophakic eyes with posterior chamber IOL were performed: group I: decompensated Fuchs dystrophy (26 patients), group II: secondary surgery-related bullous keratopathy (36 patients) exclusively. Minimal follow-up was 18 months, mean age was 73.7 years. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 32 months. The mean visual acuity on delivery was 0.11. After 6 months it was 0.23, after 1 year 0.3, after 2 years 0.35 and after 3 years 0.41 without significant differences in either group. Two years after transplantation 52.8% gained a visual acuity (VA) of > or = 0.3, after 3 years 58.6% of which 41.1% had a VA of > or = 0.5. There was a visual improvement in 83.4%; the mean spherical equivalent was -0.29 D. Refractive errors within 2 D of emmetropia were found in 56.7%; 95.1% of the grafts remained clear. Five patients had a reversible graft rejection. Extracorneal factors of impaired vision were observed in 25 patients. CONCLUSION: Despite a different VA before surgery, the visual outcome in the two groups was identical. Penetrating keratoplasty in Fuchs dystrophy and secondary bullous keratopathy with posterior chamber IOL have a much better long-term prognosis than those with iris-supported and anterior chamber IOL. Postoperative complications and graft rejections are rare.

### 6767497
### Purification and properties of cyclostome carbonic anhydrase from erythrocytes of hagfish.
### 1. Carbonic anhydrase (carbonate hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.1) has been purified from erythrocytes of hagfish (Myxine glutinosa). A single form with low specific CO2 hydration activity was isolated. The purified carbonic anhydrase appeared homogeneous judging from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration experiments. The protein has a molecular weight of about 29 000, corresponding to about 260 amino acid residues. This molecular weight is in accordance with other vertebrate carbonic anhydrases with the exception of the elasmobranch enzymes, which have Mr 36 000--39 000. 2. The molecular weight obtained for hagfish carbonic anhydrase indicates that a carbonic anhydrase with Mr approx. 29 000 is the ancestral type of the vertebrate enzyme rather than, as in sharks, a heavier carbonic anhydrase molecule. 3. The circular dichroism spectrum may indicate a somewhat different structural arrangement of aromatic amino acid residues in this enzyme than in the mammalian carbonic anhydrases. 4. The enzyme is strongly inhibited by acetazolamide and also to a lesser extent by monovalent anions. 5. Zn2+, which is essential for activity, appears, contrary to other characterized carbonic anhydrases, less strongly bound in the active site of the enzyme.

### Resistance to malarial infection is achieved by the cooperation of NK1.1(+) and NK1.1(-) subsets of intermediate TCR cells which are constituents of innate immunity.
### We previously reported that the major expanding lymphocytes were intermediate TCR (TCR(int)) cells (mainly NK1.1(-)) during malarial infection in mice. Cell transfer experiments of TCR(int) cells indicated that these T cells mediated resistance to malaria. However, TCR(int) cells always contain NK1.1(+)TCR(int) cells (i.e., NKT cells) and controversial results (NKT cells were effective or not for resistance to malaria) have been reported by different investigators. In this study, we used CD1d((-/-)) mice, which almost completely lack NKT cells in the liver and other immune organs. Parasitemia was prolonged in the blood of CD1d((-/-)) mice and the expansion of lymphocytes in the liver of these mice was more prominent after an injection of Plasmodium yoelii-infected erythrocytes. However, these mice finally recovered from malaria. In contrast to B6 mice, CD4(-)8(-) NKT cells as well as NK1.1(-)CD3(int) cells expanded in CD1d((-/-)) mice after malarial infection, instead of CD4(+) (and CD8(+)) NKT cells. These newly generated CD4(-)8(-)NKT cells in CD1d((-/-)) mice did not use an invariant chain of Valpha14Jalpha281 for TCRalpha. Other evidence was that severe thymic atrophy and autoantibody production were accompanied by malarial infection, irrespective of the mice used. These results suggest that both NK1.1(-) and NK1.1(+) subsets of TCR(int) cells (i.e., constituents of innate immunity) are associated with resistance to malaria and that an autoimmune-like state is induced during malarial infection.

### 8322364
### [Spontaneous respiration versus IPPV in pigeons]
### Veterinary textbook on anaesthesia in birds that volatile anaesthetics can accumulate in the air sac system during spontaneous respiration of birds anaesthetized with inhalational anaesthetics. In order to quantify the extent of accumulation, air samples were collected from the endotracheal tube and from the left abdominal air sac of ten pigeons anaesthetized with O2, NO2, and isoflurane. In this way, O2, CO2, and isoflurane concentrations were measured continuously at two places, during both spontaneous respiration and positive pressure ventilation. During spontaneous respiration, CO2-concentrations were higher in the air sac than in the endotracheal tube in 60% of the animals. The average difference for the whole group was 0.8 volume per cent; individual differences were as high as 2.9 volume per cent. The concentration of isoflurane was on average 1.1 volume per cent lower in the abdominal air sac than in the endotracheal tube. During mechanical ventilation, the percentage of CO2 was lower in the abdominal air sac than in the endotracheal tube in all pigeons. At the same time, the differences between isoflurane concentrations in the endotracheal tube and air sac decreased. Thus the results of our study with isoflurane-anaesthetized pigeons do not support the suggestion that volatile anaesthetics accumulate in the air sacs of spontaneously breathing birds anaesthetized with inhalation anaesthetics. The results also show that, under these conditions, CO2 concentrations in the endotracheal tube can only be measured reliably during positive pressure ventilation.

### 6421879
### Encainide and its metabolites. Comparative effects in man on ventricular arrhythmia and electrocardiographic intervals.
### To assess the relative contributions of encainide and its putatively active metabolites, O-demethyl encainide (ODE) and 3 methoxy-O-demethyl encainide (3MODE), to the drug's pharmacologic effects, we compared intravenous infusions and sustained oral therapy in two phenotypically distinct groups of patients, extensive and poor metabolizers of encainide. Unlike poor metabolizers, extensive metabolizers had appreciable quantities of both metabolites detectable in plasma and had fourfold shorter elimination half-lives for encainide. By quantitating electrocardiogram intervals, arrhythmia frequency, and plasma concentrations, we found that, in poor metabolizers, arrhythmia suppression and ventricular complex (QRS) prolongation were correlated positively with encainide concentrations (r greater than or equal to 0.570, P less than 0.014). In these two subjects, antiarrhythmic concentrations of encainide (greater than 265 ng/ml) were at least fivefold higher than those sustained in the six extensive metabolizers during steady state oral therapy. In extensive metabolizers, encainide concentrations were uncorrelated with effects. Arrhythmia suppression and QRS prolongation in extensive metabolizers correlated best with ODE (r greater than or equal to 0.816, P less than 0.001); QTc change correlated positively with both 3MODE and ODE. Arrhythmia suppression paralleled QRS prolongation; the relationship between them appeared similar in both phenotypic groups. In most patients, extensive metabolizers, encainide effects during oral therapy are mediated by metabolites, probably ODE.

### 10632494
### Cytokeratin-positive malignant tumors with reticulum cell morphology: a subtype of fibroblastic reticulum cell neoplasm?
### Cytokeratin-positive interstitial reticulum cells (CIRCs) have been described as a subset of fibroblastic reticulum cells (FBRCs) normally found in lymph nodes, the spleen, and tonsils. Although tumors derived form other reticulum (dendritic) cells, specifically follicular dendritic cells, interdigitating dendritic cells, and cytokeratin-negative FBRCs, have been well documented and are now accepted, this is not the case for tumors of CIRCs. A possible reason for this failure is the difficulty in distinguishing them from other tumors, particularly carcinoma. We report three cases of cytokeratin-positive malignant tumors with a reticulum cell morphology: two located in the mediastinum and one in the soft tissue in the proximal forearm. All cases coexpressed vimentin, and one case coexpressed smooth muscle actin and desmin, resulting in a phenotype similar to that of some normal CIRCs. Although metastatic carcinoma from an occult or regressed primary tumor cannot be excluded completely, we raise the possibility of a CIRC origin for these cases.

### 1301466
### [A study on HTP organic signs]
### A special version of the House-Tree-Person (H-T-P) technique was developed to differentiate organic psychosis from other disorders. H-T-P data of 126 psychiatric inpatients, including 16 patients with organic psychoses, 50 schizophrenics, 50 borderlines and 10 patients with other psychoses, were evaluated for the presence or absence of 29 possible features of houses, trees and persons. These features included those common to all three objects, as well as those specific to each object. Results for patients with organic psychoses were compared with those of patients with other disorders. The comparison disclosed that seven of the original 29 H-T-P features had diagnostical discrimination among treatment groups, giving higher H-T-P organic scores.

### 717335
### Oculoglandular disease of parinaud. A manifestation of cat-scratch disease.
### Among patients with cat-scratch disease, the oculoglandular form is the most common unusual manifestation. This condition, seen in 14 of 585 patients with the infection encountered in a private pediatric practice over a span of 23 years, belongs in the syndrome of the oculoglandular disease of Parinaud. Most of the 14 patients described were only mildly ill and had but little discomfort. All patients recovered without residuals. Diagnosis is based on four criteria: exposure to a cat, usually an immature one; the presence of a localized granuloma of the eye; the presence of preauricular lymphadenopathy; and a positive skin test to cat-scratch antigen of known potency. Several unusual features, never before described, of oculoglandular disease due to cat-scratch disease are submitted.

### 7537469
### Modulation of reflex pressor response to contraction and effect on substance P release by spinal 5-HT1A receptors.
### This study investigated whether activation of serotonin1A [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A] receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord attenuates the reflex pressor response to static contraction and passive muscle stretch. In addition, we determined if the attenuation of the response to contraction is mediated by inhibiting substance P (SP) release in the dorsal horn. Static contractions of the triceps surae muscle of chloralose-anesthetized cats were induced by stimulating the cut L7 and S1 ventral roots. Microdialysis (10 mM) of a selective 5-HT1A agonist [8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT)] into the L7 dorsal horn region produced a reversible attenuation of the reflex pressor response to a 1-min contraction (in mmHg: control = 36 +/- 3; 8-OH-DPAT = 17 +/- 3; recovery = 31 +/- 8; P = 0.013; n = 6) or passive stretch (in mmHg: control = 36 +/- 6; 8-OH-DPAT = 15 +/- 2; recovery = 32 +/- 6; P = 0.002; n = 6). However, a 5-HT1B agonist, 1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]piperazine, had no effect on the reflex pressor response. During 5-min contractions (n = 8), 8-OH-DPAT (10 mM) also blunted the pressor response but had no effect on the levels of SP-like immunoreactivity (in fmol/100 microliters: control = 0.492 +/- 0.026; 8-OH-DPAT = 0.501 +/- 0.034). These results suggest that activation of 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal horn attenuates the reflex pressor response to contraction through a mechanism other than inhibition of SP release.

### 12640616
### Health technology assessment in the ICU: noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure.
### Critical care practitioners have a number of health-related technologies at our disposal to provide the best possible care for our critically ill patients. Although certain technologies may improve outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU), many technologies are disseminated without rigorous evaluation. Health technology assessment (HTA) in critical care is a complex and dynamic process, which is a powerful tool to assess a health technology for its initial use or continued application in the ICU. This article applies an HTA framework to the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) for patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). The strongest evidence to date supports the use of NPPV in patients with ARF caused by exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); the benefit for patients with acute nonhypercarbic, hypoxemic respiratory failure is less clear. The success of NPPV technology depends on operator education and experience. The cost effectiveness of NPPV has been evaluated in patients with ARF caused by COPD, and cost reduction is attributed to the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia by avoiding endotracheal intubation. An HTA framework can help health care practitioners make important decisions regarding the acquisition of new technologies and the evaluation of current technologies. Careful evaluation of health technologies in the ICU should be an ongoing priority.

### 16733720
### Congenital intestinal fistula with exomphalos minor.
### Minor degrees of exomphalos have been known to be associated with vitellointestinal duct anomalies. The most frequent association is Meckel's diverticulum. It is unusual for a fistula to be communicating directly with the exomphalos sac. We report five neonates that presented with a fistula on the exomphalos sac over a 10-year period. The different variants of patent vitellointestinal duct in these cases have been discussed with a review of the literature.

### 2584234
### Photoaffinity labeling of the rabbit reticulocyte guanine nucleotide exchange factor and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 with 8-azidopurine nucleotides. Identification of GTP- and ATP-binding domains.
### We have covalently modified rabbit reticulocyte polypeptide chain initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) with the 8-azido analogs of GTP (8-N3GTP) and ATP (8-N3ATP). Of the five subunits of GEF, the Mr 40,000 polypeptide binds 8-[gamma-32P]N3GTP, and the Mr 55,000 and 65,000 polypeptides bind 8-[gamma-32P]N3ATP. Both 8-N3GTP and 8-N3ATP specifically label the beta-subunit of eIF-2. Covalent binding of 8-azidopurine analogs to the eukaryotic initiation factors is dependent on UV irradiation. Binding of 8-N3GTP and 8-N3ATP is specific for the guanine- and adenine-binding sites on the protein, respectively. GDP and GTP, but not ATP, inhibit the photoinsertion of 8-N3GTP to the protein. Similarly, ATP, but not GTP, inhibits the photoinsertion of 8-N3ATP. The inclusion of NADP+ in the reaction mixtures also interferes with the binding of 8-N3ATP to GEF. Mg2+ inhibits the binding of the 8-azido analogs of GTP and ATP to both eIF-2 and GEF, whereas EDTA stimulates the photoinsertion of these nucleotides. Identical results are obtained when the binding of GTP and ATP to these proteins, in the presence of Mg2+ or EDTA, is estimated by nitrocellulose membranes. In enzymatic assays, 8-N3GTP supports the activity of eIF-2 and GEF, indicating that the interaction of 8-N3GTP is catalytically relevant.

### 2912086
### A functional and structural study of the innervation of the human uterus.
### We characterized the innervation of human myometrial tissues by electrical field stimulation and electron microscopy. Nerve-specific parameters (pulse duration 0.6 msec) were used for electrical field stimulation to selectively activate intrinsic nerves. In specimens from nonpregnant, nonparous women (n = 6), tetrodotoxin (10(-6) mol/L) significantly reduced the response to electrical field stimulation by 70%. Contractions to electrical field stimulation were also inhibited to 60% by atropine (10(-5) mol/L) as well as by guanethidine (10(-5) mol/L) and phentolamine (10(-5) mol/L). Propranolol (10(-5) mol/L) had no detectable effect. We obtained similar results from about 50% of the specimens from nonpregnant, parous women (n = 15). The contractile responses of specimens from the term pregnant uterus (n = 13) to electrical field stimulation were not influenced by tetrodotoxin. Ultrastructurally we found nerve profiles in close proximity to muscle cells. About 30% of nerve varicosities in tissues from nonpregnant, nonparous patients could be classified as adrenergic (small, dense-cored vesicles), 53% as cholinergic (small, agranular vesicles), and about 17% as indeterminant (sometimes large, dense-cored vesicles). However, nerve varicosities were rarely observed in term pregnant specimens. These results indicate the presence of tetrodotoxin-sensitive, excitatory innervation of human myometrium consisting of alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic components. Furthermore, denervation may be nearly complete at term and recovery of innervation occurs at a considerable length of time after delivery.

### Skin manifestations of mitochondrial DNA syndromes: case report and review.
### Mitochondrial DNA syndromes are an emerging class of diseases that can present at any age. Clinical findings are legion and may include renal tubulopathy, growth retardation, myopathy, seizures, and ophthalmoplegia. Mitochondrial DNA syndromes have presented with symmetric cervical lipomas, poikiloderma, and anhidrosis. We describe a child with a novel mitochondrial DNA syndrome who had poikiloderma on sun-exposed areas. We also reviewed 274 patients with mitochondrial DNA disorders for skin findings. Symmetric cervical lipomas were consistently associated with myoclonic epilepsy as part of 1 syndrome. With the exception of lipomas, skin findings were reported in 16 patients.

### 9061646
### Membrane properties and synaptic inputs of suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons in rat brain slices.
### 1. Whole-cell recordings were made from 390 neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in horizontal brain slices during different portions of the circadian day. The locomotor activity of the rats was measured prior to the preparation of brain slices to insure that each rat was entrained to a 12 h-12 h light-dark cycle. 2. The mean input conductance was 42% higher (1.58 nS) in neurons recorded near the subjective dawn than those (1.11 nS) recorded near the subjective dusk. The current required to hold the neurons at -60 mV also showed a circadian variation with a peak in the middle of the subjective day and a nadir in the middle of the subjective night. Analysis of the variations in the input conductance and the holding current at -60 mV suggested that at least two ion conductances are involved in the pacemaking of the circadian rhythms. 3. Voltage-clamped SCN neurons often had both outward and inward spontaneous postsynaptic currents. The outward currents were blocked by bicuculline but not by strychnine, and were identified as IPSCs mediated by GABAA receptors. The inward currents were blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and were identified as EPSCs mediated by glutamate. Most spontaneous synaptic currents were miniature currents but action potential-dependent large events were seen more often in IPSCs than in EPSCs. 4. Stimulation of the optic nerve or chiasm usually evoked a monosynaptic EPSC which was mediated by both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors. In 13% of cells, optic nerve stimulation evoked an outward current or an inward current followed by an outward current; all the evoked currents were blocked by 4-aminophosphonovaleric acid (APV) and CNQX whereas the outward current only was blocked by bicuculline, suggesting involvement of an inhibitory interneuron. 5. SCN neurons sum the excitatory inputs from both optic nerves; on average each SCN cell receives innervation from at least 4.8 retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) axons. 6. Focal stimulation in the vicinity of the recorded neuron revealed that nearly all SCN neurons receive local or extranuclear GABAergic inputs operating via GABAA receptors. The EPSCs activated by such stimulation were not significantly different in amplitude and pharmacological properties from those induced by RHT stimulation. 7. One hundred and one neurons were labelled with neurobiotin during whole-cell recording. Based on the dendritic structures, four types of SCN neurons (monopolar, radial, simple bipolar and curly bipolar) were identified. The curly bipolar cells had a higher membrane conductance, holding current and hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) amplitude than the other neuronal types. Radial neurons did not respond to optic nerve stimulation, which activated EPSCs in the other cell types.

### 11675550
### Hemivertebral excision for congenital scoliosis in very young children.
### The present study reports the results of a consecutive series of six very young children who underwent single-anesthetic sequential anterior and posterior hemivertebral excision. The children, all less than 34 months old (mean age 19 months), presented with high magnitude or progressive congenital scoliosis related to an unbalanced hemivertebra. Curve correction required hemivertebral excision, which was accomplished during a single operative event using sequential anterior and posterior procedures. The intraoperative curve correction was maintained with plaster immobilization for 3 months. All patients were followed for at least 24 months. Pre-and postoperative spinal radiographs were analyzed for initial and final curve correction. Excellent correction of preoperative deformity was obtained and maintained throughout the follow-up period. The mean postoperative curve correction (67%; range 52%-84%) compared favorably with the average correction at final follow-up (70%; range 50%-85%). Radiographs revealed a consistently solid arthrodesis with no evidence of curve progression. There were no neurologic or other significant complications. In conclusion, single-anesthetic sequential anterior and posterior hemivertebral excision appears to be a safe and efficacious procedure for the management of congenital scoliosis in very young children.

### 12095056
### Immunoprophylaxis with basiliximab compared with antithymocyte globulin in renal transplant patients receiving MMF-containing triple therapy.
### Acute graft rejection remains a major problem in renal transplant recipients, and there is no consensus on the optimal immunosuppressive strategy. Immunoprophylaxis with Thymoglobulin or basiliximab has significantly reduced the incidence of acute rejection episodes and graft loss following kidney transplantation. This open, randomized, multicenter study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of basiliximab (20mg day 0-day 4) plus early cyclosporine from day 0 (n = 50) compared with Thymoglobulin plus delayed cyclosporine (n = 50) in adult kidney transplant patients. In addition, all patients received steroids and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) at standard doses from day 0. Patient and graft survival rates at 12 months were 98 and 94% in the basiliximab group, respectively, compared with 100 and 96% in the Thymoglobulin' group. The incidences of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (8.0% in each group) and treatment failure (14% in the basiliximab group vs. 8% in the Thymoglobulin group) were comparable in the two groups. There was a non-significant tendency to more dialysis (14 vs. 6%), and fewer cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections (p = 0.005) in the basiliximab group, but the percentage of clinical CMV was not different between the two groups (6 vs. 12%). Both strategies give excellent results, despite the differences in patterns, in nonhyperimmunized patients receiving their first cadaveric renal allograft.

### 1365049
### Oral syndrome: an incomplete form of cheiro-oral syndrome?
### Cheiro-oral syndrome is a sensory disturbance observed around the corner of the mouth and the palm of the hand on the same side. We had an opportunity to observe a patient in whom sensory disturbance was limited only around the corner of the left mouth but not the hands or other findings. Computed tomography of the brain showed a low density area in the right thalamus. Could our case be called oral syndrome: incomplete form of cheiro-oral syndrome? We have to ask whether the our case is an oral syndrome or whether our case has to be regarded as a thalamic infarction.

### 6763881
### Immune reactivity of spleen cells in advanced stages of tumor growth.
### In a syngeneic tumor model by an indirect migration inhibition technique, using spleen cells from mice bearing large tumors (ATB-SC) no detectable amounts of migration inhibition factor (MIF) was found in response to either tumor cells or tumor extract. Although lymphokine production was suppressed, ATB-SC were able to respond to exogenous MIF and also to transfer a positive delayed foot-pad reaction (DFR) when co-inoculated with both forms of antigen into normal mice. These observations showed that in advanced stages of tumor development, when the ability of spleen cells to produce MIF toward tumor cells or tumor extract is lost, neither their capability to transfer a positive DFR not their responsiveness to MIF-rich culture supernatants were impaired.

### 11673010
### Percutaneous sclerotherapy of a giant benign renal cyst with alcohol.
### We report a case of giant, benign renal cyst that was treated with percutaneous aspiration and sclerotherapy using 95% alcohol. A seven French catheter was inserted into the cyst under ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic guidance, and was then left in place to drain the cyst contents. Approximately 4 l of fluid was drained the first day. The following day, a gravity sinogram was obtained, which showed there were no connections between the cyst and the collecting system. The alcohol treatment involved repeated injections of decreasing amounts of alcohol, with volumes selected in accordance with follow-up sinograms. The patient's symptoms resolved and cyst drainage stopped after 3 successive days of therapy. Totally 600 ml alcohol has given. Follow-up ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) studies showed no recurrent disease; with only a small remnant of the cyst wall. We encountered no major complications during follow-up.

### Changes in bacterioplankton community structure and activity with depth in a eutrophic lake as revealed by 5S rRNA analysis.
### The community structure of bacterioplankton was studied at different depths (0 to 25 m) of a temperate eutrophic lake (Lake Plusssee in northern Germany) by using comparative 5S rRNA analysis. The relative amounts of taxonomic groups were estimated from 5S rRNA bands separated by high-resolution electrophoresis. Comparison of partial 5S rRNA sequences enabled detection of changes in single taxa over space and during seasons. Overall, the bacterioplankton community was dominated by 3 to 14 abundant (>4% of the total 5S rRNA) taxa. In general, the number of 5S rRNA bands (i.e., the number of bacterial taxa) decreased with depth. In the fall, when thermal stratification and chemical stratification were much more pronounced than they were in the spring, the correlation between the depth layers and the community structure was more pronounced. Therefore, in the fall each layer had its own community structure; i.e., there were different community structures in the epilimnion, the metalimnion, and the hypolimnion. Only three 5S rRNA bands were detected in the hypolimnion during the fall, and one band accounted for about 70% of the total 5S rRNA. The sequences of individual 5S rRNA bands from the spring and fall were different for all size classes analyzed except two bands, one of which was identified as Comamonas acidivorans. In the overall analysis of the depth profiles, the diversity in the epilimnion contrasted with the reduced diversity of the bacterioplankton communities in the hypolimnion, and large differences occurred in the composition of the epilimnion at different seasons except for generalists like C. acidivorans.

### 8869140
### The role of adenosine receptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the cardiovascular response to defence area stimulation in the rat.
### The effects of microinjections of adenosine and an adenosine receptor antagonist into the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) on the cardiovascular changes associated with the defence reaction were investigated in anaesthetized rats. Responses to electrical and chemical stimulation in RVLM were determined in alpha-chloralose-anaesthetized, paralysed and artificially ventilated rats. Microinjections of adenosine (10 nM) and the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-sulphophenyl-theophylline (8-SPT; 0.12 microM) were made into the RVLM and their effects on arterial pressure (ABP), heart rate (HR) and skeletal muscle blood flow determined. Microinjections of adenosine into the RVLM evoked either an increase or a decrease in ABP, with variable effects on HR. These actions of adenosine were blocked by prior injection of 8-SPT at the same site. Histological analysis showed that adenosine evoked an increase in arterial pressure when injected into rostral areas of the RVLM, and a depressor response when injected into caudal regions. Furthermore, microinjections of adenosine into the RVLM augmented the increase in ABP evoked by electrical stimulation of the hypothalamic defence area (HDA). Whilst microinjection of 8-SPT into RVLM had no effect on the baseline levels of the variables measured, it reduced the HDA-evoked increase in ABP. From these results we propose that adenosine modulates the cardiovascular changes evoked upon stimulation of the HDA via an action on sympatho-excitatory neurones within the rostral ventrolateral medulla.

### 6723970
### Regulation of protein synthesis in lymphoblastoid cells during inhibition of cell proliferation by human interferons.
### Treatment of human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells with interferons inhibits cell proliferation in culture within 24 h. The failure of cell growth has been shown to be associated with impaired processing and decreased stability of newly replicated DNA. Because there is a close relationship between DNA replication and protein synthesis we have measured protein synthesis in intact Daudi cells. Protein synthesis declined steadily between 24 and 96 h after interferon treatment to a value which is only 20-30% of the rate in control cells. The enzyme 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase is induced but our data do not support a role for the 2',5'-oligo(A)-activated ribonuclease in the control of translation in this system.

### 7830577
### Multiple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions are involved in transcriptional activation by MalT.
### The promoters of the Escherichia coli maltose regulon are positively regulated by the MalT protein, which recognizes a short asymmetric nucleotide sequence that is present as several copies in each promoter of the regulon. We report a detailed biochemical characterization of the interaction of MalT with the promoter of the malPQ operon. The MalT sites in malPp were precisely located and their occupation as a function of MalT concentration was quantified using DNase I and dimethyl sulphate footprinting experiments. The contribution of each site to malPp activity was assessed by introducing mutations that destroy them and measuring the residual in vivo and in vitro activity. Two main results were obtained. First, although the proximal MalT site is centred at -37.5, RNA polymerase is likely to establish a contact required for malPp activity with at least one base pair of the promoter -35 region; this close proximity between RNA polymerase and MalT bound to site 1 suggests that the two proteins interact. Second, even if the interaction of MalT with the three functional sites in malPp is a co-operative process, the MalT molecules bound to the two distal sites play a more subtle role than simply increasing the occupancy of the proximal site and may also contact RNA polymerase. We suggest that, in the nucleoprotein structure responsible for the initiation of transcription, MalT, RNA polymerase and malPp are held together by several weak interactions.

### 1896998
### Effect of lead on the glycosaminoglycans metabolism of bovine aortic endothelial cells in culture.
### We investigated the effect of lead nitrate (0.1, 1.0, 10 or 20 microM) on the metabolism of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in confluent cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells. It was found that lead at 10 and 20 microM significantly decreased the accumulation of [35S]sulfate-labeled GAG ([35S]GAG) both in the cell layer and the medium after a 24-h culture. A time course study showed that 10 microM lead decreased the accumulation of [3H]glucosamine-labeled GAG both in the cell layer and the medium after 24 h and longer. The release of [35S]GAG from the cell layer during the last 3 h of a 24 h culture was not changed by lead. The detachment of [3H]thymidine-labeled cells from the monolayer was unaffected by lead. It was shown that lead at 10 microM decreased both heparan sulfate and the other GAG in the cell layer; the former was more sensitive to lead treatment. Lead at 20 microM and below failed to increase the release of lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting that non-specific cell damage was not caused by lead. From these results, it was suggested that lead decreases endothelial cell heparan sulfate content through a decrease in the GAG production without a non-specific cell damage. Lead may be a risk factor of vascular disorders.

### 12169899
### Acanthamoeba: a rare primary cause of rhinosinusitis.
### Parasitic infections, especially Acanthamoeba, are rarely implicated as a specific cause of rhinosinusitis. It is a fatal disease found in the immunocompromised population, in particular in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Less than 10 cases of Acanthamebic rhinosinusitis have been reported in the literature, and only 1 has survived. This case report presents an Acanthamebic infection misdiagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal septum on a presumptive healthy, immunocompetent 35-year-old woman. She was later diagnosed with AIDS (AIDS) along with disseminated Acanthamoebiasis and became the second reported case surviving this deadly illness. This case report also discusses the difficulty in diagnosing this rare parasite, the pathogenesis, and the multidisciplinary treatment required to control and manage this uniformly fatal disease.

### Hormone therapy use among postmenopausal French women before the publication of the Women's Health Initiative study: duration of use and factors associated with discontinuation.
### OBJECTIVE: Compliance with recent recommendations concerning hormone therapy (HT) requires that we understand the reasons why women receiving HT continue or stop their treatment. Our aim was to estimate the duration of HT use and analyze factors associated with its discontinuation during the period before the publication of articles challenging the safety of HT. DESIGN: With data from 3 mail questionnaires--at inclusion (in 1990), 3 years, and 6 years--we estimated the cumulative treatment continuation rate by the actuarial method and used the Cox model to analyze the factors associated with discontinuation. SETTING: French women participating in the GAZEL cohort of employees of the French national power and electricity company (Electricit de France-Gaz de France). PATIENT(S): One thousand eighty-three postmenopausal women who were ever-HT users. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Discontinuation of HT. RESULT(S): A total of 91.6% of women consulted gynecologists, and 88% continued treatment 5 years after they had begun it. Those reporting hot flashes as a reason for taking HT and those younger than 45 years old at menopause were less likely to stop HT, as were women reporting alcohol use. CONCLUSION(S): Our results demonstrate the importance of providing information to physicians, primarily gynecologists, to ensure appropriate treatment of symptoms for menopausal women, especially those younger than 45 years old, while bearing their long-term health in mind.

### 6573677
### Unusual evolutionary conservation and frequent DNA segment exchange in class I genes of the major histocompatibility complex.
### From comparisons of homologous DNA sequences for many different genes, it was shown that the silent positions of protein-encoding regions and introns evolve at high and remarkably similar rates for different genes. In addition, both silent positions and introns behave like clocks; they accumulated base substitutions at approximately constant rates with respect to geological time. The rates of evolution were estimated to be 5.5 X 10(-9), 3.7 X 10(-9), and 5.3 X 10(-9) per site per year for silent positions, short introns (less than approximately equal to 300 base pairs), and long introns (more than approximately equal to 500 base pairs), respectively. Contrary to expectation from the evolutionary clocks, DNA sequence comparison between pHLA 12.4 (a cloned HLA sequence) of man and Ld together with other H-2 genes of mouse, the class I genes of the major histocompatibility complex, revealed a surprisingly small amount of base substitution for both the introns and the silent positions; the degree of divergence is only about 60% of that of standard genes in the same species comparison. Furthermore, several segmental homologies have been observed between the class I genes of mouse, suggesting the frequent occurrence of gene conversion or double unequal crossing-over in evolution. Interrelations between the extreme polymorphism of the class I genes, the low evolutionary drift of the introns and the silent positions, and the frequent gene conversion or unequal crossing-over within the mouse genes are discussed.

### [Cytological detection of a myeloic metaplasia in punctates of transplanted kidneys and their diagnostic importance (author's transl)]
### In 30 patients who had undergone renal transplantations, 45 renal biopsies were carried through for a suspected acute immuno-incompatibility (rejection) during the period from 1974-1975. Of all bioptic material taken swab-preparations were made at the same time, aiming at clarifying the cytomorphological criteria of the acute transplant rejection. In 14 out of 27 cases where an acute transplant rejection was histologically diagnosed, myelocytes and normoblasts were found in the smears. In one out of two chronic cases of transplant rejection the detection of metaplasias was negative. Thus, the detection of myeloic metaplasias in renal punctates is an important criterium for the cytodiagnostics of a transplant rejection crisis.

### 11591113
### Resistance to malarial infection is achieved by the cooperation of NK1.1(+) and NK1.1(-) subsets of intermediate TCR cells which are constituents of innate immunity.
### We previously reported that the major expanding lymphocytes were intermediate TCR (TCR(int)) cells (mainly NK1.1(-)) during malarial infection in mice. Cell transfer experiments of TCR(int) cells indicated that these T cells mediated resistance to malaria. However, TCR(int) cells always contain NK1.1(+)TCR(int) cells (i.e., NKT cells) and controversial results (NKT cells were effective or not for resistance to malaria) have been reported by different investigators. In this study, we used CD1d((-/-)) mice, which almost completely lack NKT cells in the liver and other immune organs. Parasitemia was prolonged in the blood of CD1d((-/-)) mice and the expansion of lymphocytes in the liver of these mice was more prominent after an injection of Plasmodium yoelii-infected erythrocytes. However, these mice finally recovered from malaria. In contrast to B6 mice, CD4(-)8(-) NKT cells as well as NK1.1(-)CD3(int) cells expanded in CD1d((-/-)) mice after malarial infection, instead of CD4(+) (and CD8(+)) NKT cells. These newly generated CD4(-)8(-)NKT cells in CD1d((-/-)) mice did not use an invariant chain of Valpha14Jalpha281 for TCRalpha. Other evidence was that severe thymic atrophy and autoantibody production were accompanied by malarial infection, irrespective of the mice used. These results suggest that both NK1.1(-) and NK1.1(+) subsets of TCR(int) cells (i.e., constituents of innate immunity) are associated with resistance to malaria and that an autoimmune-like state is induced during malarial infection.

### 11481954
### [Liver failure with coagulopathy in an infant with tyrosinemia]
### Tyrosinemia is an inherited autosomal recessive condition. We present a 5 week-old boy with this disorder. He was admitted because of a fever, vomiting and lethargy. The laboratory tests confirmed a coagulopathy with prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and a decreased serum fibrinogen. The alpha-fetoprotein level was markedly elevated. To confirm the diagnosis of tyrosinemia, quantitative urinary succinylacetone was measured. Although overt liver failure with coagulopathy may be part of the representation of tyrosinemia, a significant coagulopathy in the absence of overt signs of liver disease has not been emphasized as a clue to the diagnosis of this condition.

### 16837548
### Absence of NF-kappaB subunit p50 improves heart failure after myocardial infarction.
### BACKGROUND: NF kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a ubiquitous transcription factor activated by various stimuli implicated in heart failure progression including reactive oxygen species (ROS), hypoxia, and inflammatory cytokines. Although NF-kappaB is involved in ischemic preconditioning, unstable angina pectoris, and atherogenesis, its role in heart failure has not been determined. Therefore, we investigated left ventricular remodeling in mice with a targeted deletion of the NF-kappaB subunit p50/NF-kappaB1 after myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: p50 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) animals underwent coronary artery ligation. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at days 0, 21, and 56 at midpapillary levels. Early mortality was significantly lower in KO than in WT animals. Moreover, p50 KOs exhibited significantly reduced ventricular dilatation over 8 wk compared to WT controls (end-systolic diameters by transthoracic echocardiography, WT vs. KO, 0.55+/-0.04 vs. 0.34+/-0.03 cm) and preserved left ventricular contractility. Collagen content and matrixmetalloproteinase (MMP) -9 expression were significantly lower in KO mice after myocardial infarction and may account for improved left ventricular remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of the NF-kappaB subunit p50 improves early survival and reduces left ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction. NF-kappaB might therefore be an attractive target to treat heart failure.

### 4057037
### Effects of oximes, diacetylmonoxime, pyridine-2-aldoxime, and pyridine-2-aldoxime methochloride, on the electrical and mechanical activities of guinea pig cardiac ventricular muscles.
### Effects of 3 oximes, diacetylmonoxime (DAM), pyridine-2-aldoxime (PAM) and pyridine-2-aldoxime methochloride (2-PAM), on the normal electrical and mechanical activities and on the slow response action potentials were examined in the guinea pig ventricular muscles. DAM and long-term exposure to high concentrations of PAM produced decreases in contractile force, action potential duration and slow response action potentials, whereas 2-PAM and low concentrations of PAM tended to increase these parameters. Thus, these 3 oximes did not act uniformly on cardiac muscle. It was speculated that DAM and high concentrations of PAM may act as slow channel inhibitors, whereas 2-PAM and low concentrations of PAM may act as slow channel activators.

### 17488592
### Epstein-Barr virus and multiple sclerosis.
### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is one of the most common and successful human viruses, infecting more than 90% of the world's adult population. Despite its strong tumorigenic potential, most virus carriers remain healthy due to maintenance of a delicate balance between the host's immune system, which limits production of virus particles, and the virus, which persists for the duration of the host's life. New data show that this balance is altered on a subtle level in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases who show enhanced as well as less restricted T-cell and antibody responses to EBV-encoded antigens. Such quantitatively and qualitatively distinct immune responses and the virus' unique ability to immortalize B cells as well as to continuously stimulate strong T-cell responses during persistent infection suggest a possible role for EBV in the initiation and progression of symptomatic autoimmunity. We hypothesize that EBV promotes both autoimmune B and T-cell responses. EBV gene products might stimulate cross-reactive autoimmune B cells directly or increase their survival after infection. In addition, autoimmune T cells could be maintained via molecular mimicry between autoantigens and EBV antigens, and via the Th1 polarizing cytokine milieu of protective antiviral T-cell immunity. A better understanding of how EBV and EBV-specific immune control mechanisms interfere with the evolution of autoimmunity may generate a rationale for novel EBV-targeting therapeutic strategies aimed at the prevention and more efficient treatment of autoimmune diseases.

### Inhibition of T cell recruitment and cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity-induced inflammation with antibodies to monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.
### Leukocytes express chemokine receptors that, upon ligand recognition, are believed to activate and induce the directed migration of these cells from the vasculature to sites of tissue injury. Previous investigations of human and animal inflammatory tissue have revealed that expression of chemokines can be increased in association with leukocyte infiltration. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) mediates monocyte chemotaxis in vitro and migration of monocytes to inflammatory sites in vivo. More recently T cell chemotaxis to MCP-1 has been observed in vitro, but the contribution of this protein to T cell migration in vivo and to lymphocyte-mediated inflammation has not been determined. In this report, we show that using a rat model of cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity, MCP-1 expression correlates spatially and kinetically with T cell and monocyte recruitment and that antibodies directed to MCP-1 when administered therapeutically to animals undergoing delayed hypersensitivity can almost completely abolish T cell migration and inflammatory sequelae. Moreover the concentration of antibody needed to inhibit T cell trafficking to inflammatory sites is almost on order of magnitude lower than that needed to impede monocyte recruitment. Therefore, MCP-1 is functionally relevant in the genesis of delayed hypersensitivity and may be a useful therapeutic target for diseases mediated in part by T lymphocytes.

### Free fatty acids in obesity and type 2 diabetes: defining their role in the development of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction.
### Plasma free fatty acids (FFA) play important physiological roles in skeletal muscle, heart, liver and pancreas. However, chronically elevated plasma FFA appear to have pathophysiological consequences. Elevated FFA concentrations are linked with the onset of peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance and, while the precise action in the liver remains unclear, a model to explain the role of raised FFA in the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance has recently been put forward. Over 30 years ago, Randle proposed that FFA compete with glucose as the major energy substrate in cardiac muscle, leading to decreased glucose oxidation when FFA are elevated. Recent data indicate that high plasma FFA also have a significant role in contributing to insulin resistance. Elevated FFA and intracellular lipid appear to inhibit insulin signalling, leading to a reduction in insulin-stimulated muscle glucose transport that may be mediated by a decrease in GLUT-4 translocation. The resulting suppression of muscle glucose transport leads to reduced muscle glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. In the liver, elevated FFA may contribute to hyperglycaemia by antagonizing the effects of insulin on endogenous glucose production. FFA also affect insulin secretion, although the nature of this relationship remains a subject for debate. Finally, evidence is discussed that FFA represent a crucial link between insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction and, as such, a reduction in elevated plasma FFA should be an important therapeutic target in obesity and type 2 diabetes.

### [Value of neopterin as an oncologic laboratory parameter--observations in gynecologic tumors]
### First experience is presented concerning the diagnostic utility of serum neopterin determinations in cancer care. The data refer to single measurements (198 sera) and follow-up studies (30 gynecological cases) of the neopterin level of patients suffering from bowel carcinomas, mammary carcinomas, and gynecological disorders. The outcome reveals that single values do not essentially add to the diagnostic result obtainable by conventional markers. Therefore, the consistent follow-up of the neopterin level is recommended. As exemplified for a series of gynecological patients, repeatedly elevated serum neopterin values after therapeutic intervention indicate a worse prognosis than values remaining within the physiological range. These conclusions need to be more firmly established by extended observation time and a greater number of cases. To make better and reliable use of neopterin in cancer diagnosis, it is necessary to analyse the immunological background of the altered neopterin synthesis (or shedding) in malignant diseases.

### Beta 2 integrins are involved in cytokine responses to whole Gram-positive bacteria.
### Proinflammatory cytokines have an important pathophysiologic role in septic shock. CD14 is involved in cytokine responses to a number of purified bacterial products, including LPS. However, little is known of monocyte receptors involved in cytokine responses to whole bacteria. To identify these receptors, human monocytes were pretreated with different mAbs and TNF-alpha was measured in culture supernatants after stimulation with whole heat-killed bacteria. Human serum and anti-CD14 Abs significantly increased and decreased, respectively, TNF-alpha responses to the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. However, neither treatment influenced responses to any of the Gram-positive bacteria tested, including group A and B streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Complement receptor type III (CR3 or CD18/CD11b) Abs prevented TNF-alpha release induced by heat-killed group A or B streptococci. In contrast, the same Abs had no effects when monocytes were stimulated with L. monocytogenes or S. aureus. Using either of the latter bacteria, significant inhibition of TNF-alpha release was produced by Abs to CD11c, one of the subunits of CR4. To confirm these blocking Ab data, IL-6 release was measured in CR3-, CR4-, or CD14-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells after bacterial stimulation. Accordingly, streptococci triggered moderate IL-6 production (p < 0.05) in CR3 but not CD14 or CR4 transfectants. In contrast, L. monocytogenes and S. aureus induced IL-6 release in CR4 but not CR3 or CD14 transfectants. Collectively our data indicate that beta 2 integrins, such as CR3 and CR4, may be involved in cytokine responses to Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, CD14 may play a more important role in responses to whole Gram-negative bacteria relative to Gram-positive ones.

### 17944161
### African American consent and nonconsent cases: are there significant differences?
### BACKGROUND: Previous research has examined the differences in organ donation consent rates between African Americans and other racial/ethnic groups. However, there is limited examination of whether differences exist between African American families that consent and those that do not. OBJECTIVE: To examine if there are significant differences between African American families that consent to donation compared to those that do not. METHODS: A random sample of 120 African American potential donor cases from an academic medical center between 1997 and 2004 were included in this study. Variables of interest included next-of-kin relationships, family interactions, knowledge of donor wishes, family initiation of the donation discussion, and satisfaction with the donation process. RESULTS: The data include 32 consent and 88 nonconsent cases. Compared to nonconsent cases, consent cases differed significantly in next-of-kin knowledge of donor wishes, frequent involvement of parents, and infrequent involvement of spouses. Donor wishes were known in 19% of consent cases but in none of the nonconsent cases. A parent was the dominant next-of-kin decision maker in 68% of consent cases, compared to 36% of nonconsent cases. A spouse assumed the dominant role in 29% of nonconsent cases but in only 6% of consent cases. Of these differences, wishes known, parental involvement, and spousal involvement were statistically significant (P = .000, P = .002, and P = .013, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the statistically significant differences between African American consent and nonconsent cases: knowledge of donor wishes and those involved in the donation decision. These results reinforce the importance of programs that encourage African American families to discuss donation with loved ones.

### 6760083
### [Chromosome anomalies in acute lymphoblastic leukemias]
### Detectable karyotypic changes have been observed in more than 50% of the patients with ALL, distinct nonrandom chromosome abnormalities have been found. Some of these can be correlated with particular parameters such as age, morphology of the blasts, lymphocyte surface markers, prognosis. Karyotype is an important independent prognostic factor in ALL, even when other well-known risk factors are considered but an abnormal clone is not always associated with a poor prognosis. Burkitt leukemia and lymphomas have been shown to present characteristic and specific translocations t(8;14) and variants t(2;8) and t(8;22). It appears that the structural change of chromosome no 8 involving band q24 is a consistent chromosome feature in these malignancies, and that this peculiar region on chromosome no 8 probably plays an important biological role in the development of these malignant proliferations. The association of cytogenetic and molecular biology techniques would allow in the near future a better understanding of the genesis and significance of chromosome anomalies in malignant blood diseases.

### 16362671
### Psychiatric disorders and pain location in unilateral migraineurs.
### To explore the relationship between the side of pain during attacks and psychopathological features in strictly unilateral migraine, we recruited 35 patients affected by migraine with and/or without aura diagnosed according to the revised ICHD-II criteria. Seventeen patients had right side-locked pain (R-SUM), 11 had left side-locked (L-SUM) and 7 had side-shifting pain (SSM). Patients were administered the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory-State Anxiety, the Beck Depression Inventory and the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Statistical analyses showed that the L-SUM group was significantly more anxious and depressed than the other two groups of patients. Our preliminary data suggest that strictly left unilateral migraine is associated with more severe anxiety and depression. This finding appears to be consistent with studies that reported a higher degree of these disorders in patients with left cerebral hemispheric damage.

### 16371518
### Random genetic drift and gamete frequency.
### An analytic expression of conditional expectation of transient gamete frequency, given that one of the two loci remains polymorphic, is obtained in terms of the diffusion process by calculating the moments of the distribution. Using this expression, a model where linkage disequilibrium is introduced by a single mutation is considered. The conditional expectation of the gamete frequency given that the locus with the mutant allele remains polymorphic is presented. The behavior is significantly different from the monotonic decrease observed in the deterministic model without random genetic drift.

### 1943147
### Gene regulation under growth conditions. A model for the regulation of initiation of replication in Escherichia coli.
### A stochastic model is presented to describe gene regulation during growth conditions (non-steady-state), with an emphasis on the distribution of gene activation times. A non-Poissonian distribution, with a smaller variability than in steady-state, is obtained when gene activation by the regulatory protein(s) occurs before the protein(s) reach their saturation concentration. The model is applied to the regulation of initiation of chromosomal replication in Escherichia coli. The rate of initiation is shown to depend linearly on the concentration of the initiator molecule, DnaA, in good agreement with recently published data. It is suggested that the variability of initiation times could be growth rate dependent, with slow growing cells being more synchronized than fast growing ones.

### 15536000
### Developmental defects in Rb-deficient retinae.
### We recently found that the Rb protein is important for the regulation of retinal progenitor cell proliferation and rod photoreceptor development in the mouse retina. These two functions are separate for Rb and in this study we further characterize the role of Rb in retinal development. At postnatal day 12 in the retinae of Chx10-Cre;RbLox/- mice, immature cells are found in the outer nuclear layer where rods normally are differentiating. This results in alternating patches of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) that are lacking rod inputs. At this stage of development, horizontal cell processes at the outer plexiform layer do not mature appropriately and they extend into the outer nuclear layer. These disruptions in horizontal cell differentiation can persist for several weeks into the adult stage. While there are several secondary effects of the loss of Rb on retinal development including, limited cell death in the ONL, Mller glial cell activation, persistence of immature cells in the ONL, and altered nuclear morphology of cells in the ONL, we suggest that the defect in horizontal cell synapse formation at the OPL results from fewer rod inputs. Mice with other developmental defects in photoreceptor cell fate specification or glial cell activation do not exhibit a similar alteration in horizontal cell differentiation. Therefore, the retinae from Chx10-Cre;RbLox/- mice represent a unique model to study the role of rod photoreceptor inputs in horizontal cell differentiation and synapse formation.

### 17314094
### Identification of a flavonol 7-O-rhamnosyltransferase gene determining flavonoid pattern in Arabidopsis by transcriptome coexpression analysis and reverse genetics.
### Glycosylation plays a major role in the remarkable chemical diversity of flavonoids in plants including Arabidopsis thaliana. The wide diversity encoded by the large family-1 glycosyltransferase (UGT) gene family makes it difficult to determine the biochemical function of each gene solely from its primary sequence. Here we used transcriptome coexpression analysis combined with a reverse genetics approach to identify a gene that is prominent in determining the flavonoid composition of Arabidopsis. Using transcriptome coexpression analysis accessible on the ATTED-II public data base, the expression pattern of a UGT gene, UGT89C1, was found to be highly correlated with known flavonoid biosynthetic genes. No C-7 rhamnosylated flavonols were detected in either of two T-DNA ugt89c1 mutants. This specific metabolite deficiency in the mutants was complemented by stable transformation with the genomic fragment containing intact UGT89C1. Glutathione S-transferasefused recombinant UGT89C1 protein converted kaempferol 3-O-glucoside to kaempferol 3-O-glucoside-7-O-rhamnoside and recognized 3-O-glycosylated flavonols and UDP-rhamnose as substrates, but not flavonol aglycones, 3-O-glycosylated anthocyanins or other UDP-sugars. These results show that UGT89C1 is a flavonol 7-O-rhamnosyltransferase. The abundance of UGT89C1 transcripts in floral buds was consistent with the flavonoid accumulation of C-7 rhamnosylated flavonols in Arabidopsis organs. Our present study demonstrates that the integration of transcriptome coexpression analysis with a reverse genetic approach is a versatile tool for understanding a multigene family of a metabolic pathway in Arabidopsis.

### 16990126
### A quick release mechanism for abscisic acid.
### The hormone abscisic acid regulates development and survival of plants in response to environmental stresses. now demonstrate that in response to stress, abscisic acid can be made available via polymerization of a beta-glucosidase enzyme. This enzyme is reported to hydrolyze glucose-conjugated abscisic acid, thus increasing active abscisic acid concentrations.

### 8774623
### Myocardial viability in cases with persistent perfusion defects on the dipyridamole thallium-201 scintigram. A comparative study with autopsy findings.
### The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of myocardial infarction among persistent perfusion defects in dipyridamole-stress thallium scintigraphy by inspecting autopsied hearts and to evaluate whether the regional thallium activity of a scintigraphic defect can predict the presence of infarction. Autopsied hearts were compared with dipyridamole myocardial scintigrams undertaken during life in 27 patients (mean age 85 +/- 8 years). The time interval from stress testing until death was 428 +/- 351 days. Regional thallium uptake of delayed perfusion defect was calculated on the short axis images. The grade of regional myocardial fibrosis in autopsy specimens was also quantified to correlate with the corresponding regional thallium uptake. In 6 of 15 (40%) regions with persistent defects on the scintigram, myocardial infarction was not found at autopsy. Regional thallium-201 uptake of delayed defects < 50% diagnosed infarction with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 80%. A linear correlation (r = -0.67) was observed between percent thallium-201 uptake and the degree of myocardial fibrosis. In conclusion, perfusion defects at 4-hour imaging in dipyridamole-stress testing may overestimate the presence of myocardial infarction and regional thallium-201 activity is helpful in distinguishing between defects with and without infarction.

### 12476532
### Urinary tract infections cranberry juice, underwear, and probiotics in the 21st century.
### There is a substantial gap between the viewpoint of urologists and the rest of society regarding UTIs. Urologists spend little time and effort thinking about UTIs. In contrast, UTIs are a major issue for many women. There is substantial concern about "natural compounds" and probiotics that allow women to take charge of their health care. It is easy to understand this concern because UTIs are common, costly, and cause considerable morbidity.

### 12737269
### Discovery of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl acetate, a new alarm component in the sting apparatus of Africanized honeybees.
### We analyzed the alarm pheromone components from five colonies of Africanized honeybees and three colonies of European honeybees collected in Mexico. Analyses revealed a novel alarm pheromone component that was only present in appreciable quantities in the Africanized bee samples. Analysis of the mass spectrum and subsequent synthesis confirmed that this compound is 3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl acetate (3M2BA), an unsaturated derivative of IPA. In Africanized honeybees, sampling from stings of guards showed that 3M2BA was present at levels of 0-38% the amount of isoamyl acetate (IPA). Behavioral assays from three colonies each of Africanized and European bees showed that 3M2BA recruited worker bees from hives of both Africanized bees and European bees at least as efficiently as isopentyl acetate IPA, a compound widely reported to have the highest activity for releasing alarm and stinging behavior in honeybees. However, a mixture of of 3M2BA and IPA (1:2) recruited bees more efficiently than either of the compounds alone. None of the compounds differed in their efficacy for inducing bees to pursue the observers.

### 12073760
### Decentralization of the DOTS programme within a Russian penitentiary system. How to ensure the continuity of tuberculosis treatment in pre-trial detention centres.
### BACKGROUND: In Kemerovo region (Siberia), three pre-trial detention centres (SIZO; Ministry of Justice) serve as the gateway to the penitentiary system, comprised of 23 prisons and 30,000 detainees. The follow-up for tuberculosis (TB) patients released into civil society is unreliable. Due to varying detention times and frequent transfers to temporary detention centres (IVS; Ministry of Internal Affairs) for investigation and trial, and concerns about continuity of treatment, SIZOs were not included in the revised TB control programme initiated during 1996. METHODS: To investigate the feasibility of DOTS (Directly Observed Therapy, Short-Course) expansion into SIZOs, general detainee release was studied by examining 10% of files from detainees admitted during 1998 (SIZOs 1,2,3). Then, 5% of general files from SIZO 1 were examined to determine SIZO-IVS flow; 224 TB patient files from SIZO 3 were evaluated to determine the pattern of release/transfer. RESULTS: TB patients in SIZO 3 have less chance of release before six months of detention than non-TB detainees (14/224, 6.3% versus 774/2276, 34%; p < 0.001). Among detainees not released, 60% are not moved during the first six months of detention. For those who move, the mean stay in IVS was 9.5 (+/- 6) days. The incidence of active disease detected upon entry to SIZO 3 was 4,560/100,000, the subsequent rate during the same year of detention 880/100,000. CONCLUSION: Despite frequent detainee movements between institutions, DOTS should be introduced into the earliest stages of detention to prevent case mismanagement, and links to the civilian programme should be developed.

### 2288991
### [A study of hexokinase isoenzymes in rat sarcoma M-1]
### Using a wide spectrum of criteria, the isozyme composition of hexokinase from sarcoma M-1 reinoculated to rat m. gastrocnemius was studied. The structural, physicochemical and functional properties of the homogeneous enzyme which is represented in sarcoma M-1 by one molecular form, were investigated. Some properties of the enzyme (amino acid composition, resistance to mild proteolysis, Mr, pH-dependence of enzyme activity, electrophoretic mobility, kinetic behaviour) indicate that sarcoma M-1 hexokinase is a specific form of the enzyme which differs markedly from other known isozymes of mammalian hexokinase. The observed peculiarities of sarcoma M-1 hexokinase are discussed in terms of present-day concepts on the structure of isozymic spectra of enzymes in neoplastic tissues.

### 17700383
### Direct inhibition of renin as a cardiovascular pharmacotherapy: focus on aliskiren.
### The important role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade in the treatment of systemic hypertension, heart failure, diabetic kidney disease, and atherogenesis has been clearly established. The theoretical therapeutic advantages for inhibiting the detrimental effects of the renin-angiotensin system at its most upstream point have served as the impetus for the development of renin inhibitors. The advent of aliskiren, the first in a novel class of orally active, nonpeptide, highly specific, human renin inhibitors, provides a new modality in the armamentarium of renin-angiotensin system antagonists. Studies in marmosets and rats demonstrated that aliskiren reduced blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner and is highly efficacious in blocking plasma renin activity with parallel reductions in the levels of the other downstream constituents of the renin-angiotensin system. Clinical trials in hypertensive patients have confirmed these benefits with aliskiren whose blood pressure-lowering efficacy is similar to or better than those of standard therapeutic doses of enalapril, losartan, irbesartan, and hydrochlorothiazide. Aliskiren is well tolerated, with few reported adverse effects even at the highest doses tested. Given the established beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in the treatment of cardiovascular and renovascular diseases, future studies may further elucidate a similar protective role for aliskiren both as a monotherapy and as part of a combination therapy.

### 11911513
### Prediction of long-term functional outcome after stroke rehabilitation.
### OBJECTIVE: To find patient characteristics in the early post stroke phase that could predict three years functional outcome. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: In-hospital rehabilitation department (admission and discharge). Outpatient department one and three years post stroke. SUBJECTS: One hundred and forty-two stroke patients (56% women), median age 75 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Barthel Index (BI) score; BI score change; accommodation status; Rankin scale score; and Frenchay Activities Index (FAI) score, all registered three years post stroke. RESULTS: The percentages of patients still living at home after one and three years were 88% and 83%, respectively. Twenty per cent of the patients had deteriorated according to the BI after three years, mostly due to recurrent strokes (odds ratio (OR) 10.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0-35.5) and co-morbidity with other disabling disorders (OR 3.9; CI 1.1-13.5). Co-morbidity also emerged as an important risk factor for dependency according to BI score (OR 8.8; Cl 2.4-32.1) as well as for a poor FAI score (OR 4.9; CI 1.9-13.0). BI in the early phase was the strongest predictor for long-term functional outcome. Urinary incontinence emerged as a risk factor for nursing home placement after three years (OR 3.2; CI 0.9-11.3). Cognitive dysfunction was a risk factor for poor FAI scoring (OR 2.7; CI 1.0-7.0). CONCLUSIONS: After stroke rehabilitation, concomitant chronic disabling disorders and recurrent strokes seem to play an important role regarding dependency, handicap and long-term functional decline.

### 17900847
### Nasal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in healthy children and adults in northern Taiwan.
### A total of 427 subjects were surveyed for the carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae before the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in northern Taiwan. Positive results were identified in 27% of 94 children attending 6 classes in a child care center (CCC), 14% of 122 pupils attending 4 classes in 2 elementary schools, and 1.4% of 74 adolescents attending 3 classes in a junior middle school. None of 137 health care workers working in neonatal intensive care units of a university-affiliated hospital was colonized with S. pneumoniae. Three (12%) of 25 isolates from the children attending the CCC were susceptible to penicillin (MIC <0.1 mug/mL), whereas 8 (44%) of 18 isolates from the pupils and adolescents were susceptible (P = 0.0312). Of the 43 isolates, 11 serotypes were identified and serotypes/serogroups 6 (13 isolates), 23 (10 isolates), and 19 (7 isolates) were the 3 most common serotypes/serogroups. The genotypes of the 43 isolates were diverse, but it was not infrequently seen that several isolates from the subjects in a single class shared a common genotype. Conclusively, the carriage rate of S. pneumoniae is inversely correlated with the age of the subjects. The isolates from the children attending the CCC had a significantly higher penicillin-nonsusceptible rate than those from the pupils and adolescents. Transmission of the same clone in a single class may have frequently occurred.

### 7830577
### Multiple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions are involved in transcriptional activation by MalT.
### The promoters of the Escherichia coli maltose regulon are positively regulated by the MalT protein, which recognizes a short asymmetric nucleotide sequence that is present as several copies in each promoter of the regulon. We report a detailed biochemical characterization of the interaction of MalT with the promoter of the malPQ operon. The MalT sites in malPp were precisely located and their occupation as a function of MalT concentration was quantified using DNase I and dimethyl sulphate footprinting experiments. The contribution of each site to malPp activity was assessed by introducing mutations that destroy them and measuring the residual in vivo and in vitro activity. Two main results were obtained. First, although the proximal MalT site is centred at -37.5, RNA polymerase is likely to establish a contact required for malPp activity with at least one base pair of the promoter -35 region; this close proximity between RNA polymerase and MalT bound to site 1 suggests that the two proteins interact. Second, even if the interaction of MalT with the three functional sites in malPp is a co-operative process, the MalT molecules bound to the two distal sites play a more subtle role than simply increasing the occupancy of the proximal site and may also contact RNA polymerase. We suggest that, in the nucleoprotein structure responsible for the initiation of transcription, MalT, RNA polymerase and malPp are held together by several weak interactions.

### PCR assay for species-specific identification of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
### Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is the second most frequently encountered species of the anaerobes isolated from clinical specimens. We developed a PCR-based assay for the rapid identification of B. thetaiotaomicron. Specific primers were based on shared amplicons of about 1.2 kb generated from B. thetaiotaomicron by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA. This 1.2-kb fragment was sequenced and then used to design a set of PCR amplification primers. This PCR generated an amplification product of 721 bp, which was unique to all 65 isolates of B. thetaiotaomicron tested. There was no amplification with isolates of other bacterial species. Restriction enzyme digestion of the amplification product and dot blot hybridization further verified the specificity of the assay. These results suggest that this PCR assay targets a nucleotide sequence that is strongly conserved in B. thetaiotaomicron. This simple and rapid PCR assay provides a rapid and accurate method for identification of B. thetaiotaomicron and shows promise for the detection of B. thetaiotaomicron in clinical samples.

### Association between secondary flow in models of the aorto-celiac junction and subendothelial macrophages in the normal rabbit.
### In order to examine the association between arterial fluid dynamics and the distribution of subendothelial macrophages in the normal rabbit aorta, steady and pulsatile particle flow visualization was performed in a geometrically realistic model of the rabbit aorto-celiac junction region. Over a range of aorto-celiac steady flow ratios, particle pathlines along the upstream lateral aortic walls curved to enter the celiac orifice, while two asymmetric regions of reversing spiral secondary flow originated along the downstream lateral portions of the orifice flow divider. These regions increased in size as either the Reynolds number or flow into the celiac artery increased. In pulsatile flow studies, particles along the lateral aortic walls near the celiac orifice began to spiral into the branch during peak systole. During systolic deceleration, the size of this spiral flow region increased as particles reversed direction to enter the celiac orifice. This contrasted with flow patterns directly upstream and downstream of the orifice, which remained unidirectional throughout this period even along the distal lip of the orifice. The highest frequency of subendothelial white blood cells in the normal rabbit aorta was associated with regions where secondary flow patterns occurred, and where the orientation of endothelial cell nuclei deviated from the major direction of aortic flow. Secondary flow patterns may aid the accumulation of monocytes and macrophages about the lateral regions of the celiac artery flow divider by transporting monocytes to the walls, allowing them time to attach to the endothelial cells, or by stimulating the endothelial cells to express leukocyte adhesion molecules. These same regions are associated with increased endothelial permeability to low density lipoprotein and, under hypercholesterolemic conditions, lesion origination.

### 10469308
### Genetic mapping and physical cloning of UVB susceptibility region in mice.
### One of the most important goals of cancer research is to identify environmental and host factors that contribute to the malignant state. Human skin cancers are among the few tumor types for which the predominant environmental carcinogen is known. Ultraviolet light, a component of sunlight, is an important cause of skin cancer in humans. In humans and mice, ultraviolet B radiation induces systematic and local immunosuppression. A consequence of that is inappropriate immune surveillance of somatic tissues for evidence of malignantly transformed cells. The impairment of contact hypersensitivity, as it develops early and correlates well with tumor frequency in various mouse strains, has been used for over 15 y as a model of immunologic events occurring in photocarcinogenesis. In mice, as well as in humans, ultraviolet B radiation induced impairment of contact hypersensitivity is not uniform in all individuals; some individuals are susceptible to the deleterious effects of ultraviolet B, whereas others are resistant to ultraviolet B. We have defined the genetic locus responsible for ultraviolet B susceptibility and resistance in mice within the Bat5 and H-2D segment of the mouse chromosome 17.

### 11027323
### Macroscopic phase separation in high-temperature superconductors.
### High-temperature superconductivity is recovered by introducing extra holes to the Cu-O planes, which initially are insulating with antiferromagnetism. In this paper I present data to show the macroscopic electronic phase separation that is caused by either mobile doping or electronic instability in the overdoped region. My results clearly demonstrate that the electronic inhomogeneity is probably a general feature of high-temperature superconductors.

### [Effect of patient age on use of the knee joint score]
### AIM OF THE STUDY: Clinical studies are done with the help of scores though different factors of influence lower comparability. The underlying study examines the influence of patient age as this always presents a certain span. METHOD: 96 degree I damaged knee joints were examined by 3 examiners using the Larson-, Lysholm-, Marshall-, HSS- and OAK-score. Furthermore ratings by a VAS and the Tegner activity score were done. With the Friedman test, the rank correlation coefficient by Spearman and the contingency chart by Bowker it was tested if the examiners and the scores rate equally. To find out the influence of the age three age groups were made up. RESULTS: The examiners judged significantly different excluding the Marshall and the OAK scores. In between two examiners no significant difference could be found between the young and the middle-aged patient group. Between two other examiners no significant difference was found only for the Lysholm and the HSS score in the young group and only for the Lysholm score in the middle-aged group. In the group of the senior patients no significant difference for the scores by Lysholm, Marshall and OAK were found. In the comparison of the second examiner pair no significant differences could be proven by the scores by Larson, the OAK and the HSS. All other comparisons were significantly different. In the comparison of all five scores significant differences were seen between the Larson score and the HSS and the Lysholm and the HSS. The Lysholm score proved to be the strictest, the HSS to be the leanest. CONCLUSION: Especially for the senior patients in dependency of the examiner and the chosen score significant differences were found concluding that the relevance of results lessens for future times as the score results drop with patient age anyway. The age span in one study should have a maximum of 10-20 years to reduce the influence of age on the final result.

### Soft agar colony formation of mouse epidermal cells during the early phase of two-stage chemically induced carcinogenesis.
### A single topical application of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) followed by twice-weekly 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment was given to the skin of female CD-1 mice, and soft agar colony formation of the epidermal cells was evaluated periodically during the treatment. From the second week, colony growth was observed and the number of colonies increased with time, reaching a significant level from the fourth week. Colony formation was observed earlier than papilloma development in the mouse skin. Soft agar colony-forming assay might be a useful tool to analyze the early events in carcinogenesis.

### 16363122
### [Comparing studies on the differences of CCl4 liver injury and immunity liver injury mice models]
### Comparison between CCl4 liver injury model and immunity liver injury model was studied through physiological, biochemical and gene expression profile methods, and the pathological mechanism of them were discussed. There are significant changes about the physiological, biochemical parameters including ALT,AST between two model groups and normal control group. Among the 14112 target genes, 379 and 293 differentially expressed genes were screened out from the both two model groups respectively in gene expression profile experiments, including 105 common, differentially expressed genes. The results indicate that the two models of CCl4 and immunity have some similarities. However, the differences between them are also obvious. It is useful for the further investigation on the liver-injury mechanism and pathological process of the two different liver-injury models.

### 14722256
### Quantitative effects on c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase signaling determine synergistic interaction of cisplatin and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin in colon cancer cell lines.
### We investigated the effects of cisplatin and the hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in combination in a panel of human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines that differ in their p53 and mismatch repair status. Analysis of cytotoxicity after combined treatment revealed additive effects of cisplatin and 17-AAG in the HCT 116, DLD1, and SW480 cell lines and antagonism in HT-29 cells. Clonogenic assays demonstrated antagonism in HT-29, an additive effect in SW480, and synergism in HCT 116 and DLD1 cell lines. Analysis of signaling pathways revealed that cisplatin-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was fully blocked by 17-AAG in HT-29 and SW480 cells, whereas in HCT 116 and DLD1 cells it was inhibited only partially. The activation of caspases was also more pronounced in DLD1 and HCT 116 cell lines. These data suggested that a minimal level of apoptotic signaling through JNK was required for synergism with this combination. To test this hypothesis, we used the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125; when JNK was inhibited pharmacologically in HCT 116 and DLD1 cells, they demonstrated increased survival in clonogenic assays. Alternatively, sustained activation of JNK pathway led to an increase of the cytotoxicity of the cisplatin/17-AAG combination in HT-29 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the synergistic interaction of this combination in colon cancer cell lines depends on the effect exerted by 17-AAG on cisplatin-induced signaling through JNK and associated pathways leading to cell death. An implication of that finding is that quantitative effects of signaling inhibitors may be critical for their ability to reverse cisplatin resistance.

However, an evidence base for the influence of periodontal disease on vital organs such as heart, lung has only recently begun to be established. We are hopeful that this information will stimulate new collaborations between physicians and dentist and serve as basis for studies to help improve the total health.

### 16582649
### Single-stage thoracolumbar vertebrectomy with circumferential reconstruction and arthrodesis: surgical technique and results in 15 patients.
### OBJECTIVE: Circumferential reconstruction and arthrodesis can be necessary after thoracolumbar vertebrectomy. The authors describe a technique for single-stage thoracolumbar vertebrectomy with circumferential reconstruction and arthrodesis. The surgical results using this technique are reviewed. METHODS: Fifteen patients ranging from 14 to 75 years of age underwent single-stage thoracolumbar vertebrectomy with circumferential reconstruction and arthrodesis. The vertebrectomy was performed through a posterior midline approach. Anterior column reconstruction was performed with expandable or nonexpandable cages. Anterior and posterolateral arthrodeses used autograft. Posterior segmental instrumentation was used in all cases. RESULTS: Fifteen procedures have been performed to date, 4 for tumor and 11 for fracture. The range of treated levels was T4 to L2 (7 thoracic spine and 8 lumbar spine levels). One patient was incomplete preoperatively (Frankel Grade C) and improved to being intact postoperatively (Frankel Grade E), another improved from Frankel Grade C to Frankel Grade D. All other patients were neurologically unchanged postoperatively. Mean operative time was 4.0 hours. Average blood loss was 1100 ml. Average number of levels fused was 5.8 (range 4-9). There were four complications: one delayed transient neurological deficit after deformity correction, one infection, one postoperative myocardial infarction, and one hardware failure. All patients were treated and had a good recovery. CONCLUSION: The authors present a method for thoracolumbar vertebrectomy, circumferential reconstruction, and arthrodesis performed in a single stage, solely via a posterior approach. This is an alternative to anterior (i.e., thoracoabdominal and retroperitoneal) and lateral (i.e., lateral extracavitary) approaches that can be used for circumferential reconstruction and arthrodesis. Potential advantages and pitfalls are discussed.

### 17278460
### A fuzzy min-max neural network classifier with compensatory neuron architecture.
### This paper proposes a fuzzy min-max neural network classifier with compensatory neurons (FMCNs). FMCN uses hyperbox fuzzy sets to represent the pattern classes. It is a supervised classification technique with new compensatory neuron architecture. The concept of compensatory neuron is inspired from the reflex system of human brain which takes over the control in hazardous conditions. Compensatory neurons (CNs) imitate this behavior by getting activated whenever a test sample falls in the overlapped regions amongst different classes. These neurons are capable to handle the hyperbox overlap and containment more efficiently. Simpson used contraction process based on the principle of minimal disturbance, to solve the problem of hyperbox overlaps. FMCN eliminates use of this process since it is found to be erroneous. FMCN is capable to learn the data online in a single pass through with reduced classification and gradation errors. One of the good features of FMCN is that its performance is less dependent on the initialization of expansion coefficient, i.e., maximum hyperbox size. The paper demonstrates the performance of FMCN by comparing it with fuzzy min-max neural network (FMNN) classifier and general fuzzy min-max neural network (GFMN) classifier, using several examples.

### 14502992
### Phospholipid-based signaling in plants.
### Phospholipids are emerging as novel second messengers in plant cells. They are rapidly formed in response to a variety of stimuli via the activation of lipid kinases or phospholipases. These lipid signals can activate enzymes or recruit proteins to membranes via distinct lipid-binding domains, where the local increase in concentration promotes interactions and downstream signaling. Here, the latest developments in phospholipid-based signaling are discussed, including the lipid kinases and phospholipases that are activated, the signals they produce, the domains that bind them, the downstream targets that contain them and the processes they control.

### 1883084
### Experimental establishment of persistent infection in swine with a zoonotic strain of Salmonella newport.
### An experiment was conducted to determine whether a persistent Salmonella newport infection could be established in swine, to determine duration of shedding and distribution of the organism in internal organs, and to determine whether changes occurred in antimicrobial susceptibility or plasmid profile of the organism during the course of long-term infection. Naturally farrowed Salmonella-free pigs (n = 22) were orally exposed to a multiply antimicrobial-resistant zoonotic strain of S newport when they were 7 weeks old. Tonsillar and rectal swab specimens were examined bacteriologically for S newport during the first week after exposure, then weekly for 7 weeks. Fecal samples were likewise examined weekly or every 2 weeks for 28 weeks after exposure. Necropsies of 2 or 3 randomly selected pigs were conducted at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 weeks after exposure. A total of 45 specimens/pig representing the following internal organs or tissues were examined bacteriologically for S newport: liver, spleen, kidney, gallbladder, heart, heart blood, lung, stomach, and tonsils; segments of the intestinal tract with corresponding lymph nodes; and lymph nodes from lymphocenters of the head and neck, thoracic cavity, thoracic limbs, abdominal viscera, and abdominal wall. Exposure to S newport induced a mild and transient clinical response. The organism was recovered from 97% of tonsillar swab specimens and 89% of rectal swab specimens collected during 7 weeks after exposure and from 98% of fecal samples collected during 28 weeks after exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

### Fatality due to severe Salmonella enteritis associated with acute renal failure and septicemia.
### A 66-year-old man was hospitalized for abdominal pain and diarrhea of more than 10 times a day. He had been under regular medication with prednisolone for rheumatoid arthritis. On admission, laboratory data and clinical examination indicated inflammation, dehydration, acute renal failure with a high level of serum musculogenic enzyme (creatine kinase), and ileus. Salmonella enteritidis was isolated from his fecal and blood samples. The patient died within 24 hours after admission, and autopsy showed hemorrhagic necrotic enteritis localized to the ileum. Enterocolitis due to Salmonella enteritidis, which is usually an acute self-limited gastrointestinal illness, may occasionally be a serious and lethal disease.

### Isolation and molecular identification of echovirus 13 isolated from patients of aseptic meningitis in Korea, 2002.
### During 2002, several epidemics of aseptic meningitis were attributed to echovirus 13 in Korea. The causative agents of these outbreaks were isolated and identified using rhabdosarcoma cells, HEp-2 and Buffalo green monkey kidney cells, and a neutralization test using monospecific antiserum. Fifty-four echovirus 13 isolates were isolated from patients with aseptic meningitis in the provinces, Seoul, Kyonggi, Gwangju, Jeonju, Busan, and Ulsan. Symptoms associated with aseptic meningitis infection in patients included the occurrence of headaches and mild fever. Molecular characterization of echovirus 13 samples was achieved by sequence and phylogenetic analyses on partial VP1 sequences from 20 Korean isolates and 10 foreign isolates listed in Genbank. Minor variation was observed among the Korean isolates, which formed a unique cluster with isolates of German and Japanese origin. The marked similarities between isolates could be attributed to a relatively recent arrival of the virus in Korea. This is the first such investigation of aseptic meningitis caused by echovirus 13 on the Korean peninsula.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The total, convection/diffusion, and membrane adsorption components of beta2M clearance in 10 hemodialysis patients treated with on-line HDF at the replacement fluid rates of 75 (HDF75) and 125 (HDF125) mL/min, were determined and compared with HFHD. RESULTS: The total beta2M clearance in the HDF 125 group was significantly higher than the HDF75 group (124.5 +/- 4.4 vs 101.3 +/- 4.1 mL/min; p < 0.05); both values were much greater than the HFHD group (p < 0.01). The convection/diffusion was the major portion of total beta2M clearance in all three groups. The values of convection/diffusion and membrane adsorption in both HDF groups were about 2 and 3 times, respectively, of the HFHD group (p < 0.01). Both components of beta2M clearance in the HDF125 group did not statistically differ from the HDF75 group, however; the value of convection/diffusion clearance in HDF125 was more than in the HDF75 group. Regarding Kt/Vurea and phosphate clearance, there were no significant differences among the study groups. CONCLUSION: On-line HDF could provide more beta2M clearance than HFHD by increasing both the convection/ diffusion, and membrane adsorption clearances. HDF125 provided more total beta2M clearance than HDF75 from the convection/diffusion mechanism while the adsorptive mechanisms were equal.

### 15640924
### Noncommunicable disease mortality in the Russian Federation: from legislation to policy.
### Political, social and economic transitions that occurred as a result of the regime change in Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation from the late 1980s to the early 1990s led to a sudden increase in mortality across the region, with more than 80% of deaths being attributable to preventable causes, such as cardiovascular disease, lifestyle factors and injuries. The Russian Federation has experienced some of the most dramatic population declines in the world. Countrywide health reforms have been implemented, although they continue to ignore the impact of the epidemic of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in the Russian Federation. Improvements in mortality patterns in the Russian Federation are possible only with the broader engagement of organized nongovernmental groups within the civil society that is strongly supported by Federal legislation to address NCDs. We discuss the Russian Federal legislation germane to the prevention and control of NCDs in the light of the current mortality crisis and suggest possible policy responses to this crisis.

### Inhibition of Ku heterodimer DNA end binding activity during granulocytic differentiation of human promyelocytic cell lines.
### The heterodimeric Ku protein (composed of the Ku 86 and Ku 70 sub-units) is a nuclear protein which binds to DNA termini without sequence specificity. Ku is the DNA-targeting component of the large catalytic sub-unit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex that is required for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks in mammalian cells. We studied the expression and function of Ku/DNA-PK during granulocytic differentiation of two human promyelocytic cell lines, HL60 and NB4, a process associated to decreased radiation resistance. After 3 days exposure to differentiating agents (either all-trans-retinoic acid or DMSO), Ku binding to double stranded (ds)-DNA ends declined dramatically whereas Ku protein levels remain unchanged. The nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, fraction of differentiated HL60 cells extracts exhibited a heat-sensitive inhibitory activity towards DNA binding of recombinant Ku heterodimer. We further demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Ku is impaired in extracts from differentiated cells by using two antibodies that recognize epitopes within the C-terminus DNA binding domains of Ku 70 and Ku 86 proteins. These results favor the hypothesis of a protein interacting with Ku that would prevent DNA binding of heterodimerized Ku protein by steric hindrance.

### 1567385
### A toxic protein from Bryonia dioica Jacq. fruits: the brydiofin.
### A toxic protein isolated from Bryonia dioica Jacq. fruits is described. The fruit extract, obtained in phosphate buffer saline, in mild conditions, showed a strongly toxic activity after intraperitoneal injection of 0.4 mg per Balb/c mouse that was killed in eighteen minutes. The extract, filtered through a Bio-Gel P-60 column, presented a main peak that showed similar toxicity. When the material from this peak was analyzed in polyacrylamide slab gels, a single band corresponding to a molecular weight of about 66,000 was observed. The lethal effect of B. dioica fruit could be attributed to a protein that we called Brydiofin. The extracts from roots and leaves that did not present this toxicity showed no band in this molecular weight region.

### 2185304
### A genetic sexing system to improve the sterile insect technique against the Mediterranean fruit fly.
### The autosomal recessive allele v wing (v) in the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), produces flies that when reared at 30 degrees C have stubby wings. The mutant was used to construct a translocation-based genetic sexing system in an attempt to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the sterile insect release method for field control.

### 3043187
### Molecular tools for inactivating a yeast enzyme in vivo.
### As part of an effort to develop a new means of inducibly inactivating cellular proteins in vivo, three monoclonal antibodies which neutralize yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity were isolated and characterized with respect to criteria important for the inactivation strategy. The significance of these criteria is considered, and a general means of generating appropriate antibodies is suggested. All three antibodies described here were specific for ADH I; they did not recognize the closely related isozyme ADH II in a plate-binding assay and did not immunoprecipitate molecules other than ADH from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae extract. Neutralization occurred in a yeast extract and, for two antibodies, was blocked by high concentrations of the coenzyme NAD+. This finding suggests that the antibodies may block enzyme activity by stabilizing an inactive form of ADH lacking bound NAD+. These results provide a foundation for the use of these antibodies to inactivate ADH in vivo.

### 697752
### The transport of alpha-aminoisobutyrate into Crithidia fasciculata.
### The transport of alpha-aminoisobutyrate into Crithidia fasciculata was characterized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Kinetic data for alpha-aminoisobutyrate transport were consistent with the operation of a single system of broad specificity that showed no marked dependence on Na+. Under anaerobic conditions alpha-aminoisobutyrate transport was inhibited by uncouplers such as 2,4-dinitrophenol, lipophilic cations such as methyltriphenylphosphonium ion and adenosine triphosphatase inhibitors such as dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide and NaN3. A working model in which alpha-aminoisobutyrate enters this organism by an H+-symport mechanism, the electrochemical gradient of protons being maintained by an H+-translocating adenosine triphosphatase on the cytoplasmic membrane, is proposed.

### 8690575
### Comparison of direct alpha spectrometry and neutron activation analysis of aerosol filters for determination of workplace thorium air concentrations.
### Direct alpha spectrometry with three different filter types was investigated for the determination of thorium air concentrations at workplaces in the manufacturing process of discharge lamps containing thoriated tungsten electrodes. The method was compared with neutron activation analysis over an activity range of five orders of magnitude. Within the experimental limits of error, both methods were found to be comparable with respect to sensitivity and accuracy. The advantage of direct alpha spectrometry, however, is that it is less laborious than neutron activation analysis and that it supplies information on the degree of radioactive equilibrium of the thorium series, which is important with regard to the estimation of dose.

### 10574202
### Extraction and determination of oxybutynin in human bladder samples by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.
### A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method is described for the determination of oxybutynin (OXB) in human bladder samples. Following homogenization, tissue samples underwent double extraction with hexane and eventually were concentrated by freeze-drying before analysis. Chromatographic separation was performed with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-water-1 M ammonium acetate, pH 7.0 (85:13:2, v/v/v) at a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min and double (electrochemical and UV) detection was applied. The retention time of oxybutynin eluting peak was around 18 min. Using a standard curve range of 10 to 500 ng/ml the quantification limit with electrochemical detection was 5 ng/ml with an injection volume of 100 microl. Within-day and day-to-day relative standard deviation values were 4.9 and 9.81%, respectively, while a 94% accuracy and a 72% recovery was attained. We applied this method to compare the OXB levels into bladder wall tissue samples after passive diffusion and after electromotive drug administration (EMDA), using a two-chambered poly(vinyl chloride) diffusion cell designed and developed in our laboratory. The results obtained show that EMDA enhanced OXB penetration into bladder wall and that this novel way of local drug administration can be potentially used in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction or urinary incontinence.

### 1687633
### Physical mapping of the Coxiella burnetii genome.
### Coxiella burnetii isolates from different genomic groups contain restriction fragment polymorphisms that were easily distinguishable using pulsed field gradient electrophoresis (PFGE). Conversely, isolates that belong to the same genomic group yield identical patterns indicating that PFGE can be used to identify the genomic grouping of new C. burnetii isolates. Intact C. burnetii cells were embedded in agarose and lysed in situ. The genomic DNA was digested with low-frequency cutting restriction endonucleases, and subjected to PFGE analysis. NotI and SfiI cut C. burnetii DNA least often and produced the largest fragments. ApaI, MluI, SalI, XbaI or XhoI produced only small DNA fragments (+/- 50 kbp). When PFGE was used to analyse C. burnetii genomes for the presence of plasmid-related sequences, all the plasmid sequences in Nine Mile and Priscilla were associated with their 36 kbp or 39 kbp plasmid bands, respectively. If these isolates contained plasmid sequences which had integrated into their chromosomes those sequences would have been visible as additional bands. These same studies also showed that plasmid sequences in the plasmidless-Ko isolate were completely contained within two NotI fragments, indicating that the integrated plasmid is localized to a concise region of the C. burnetii genome. Since it is difficult to conduct genetic analyses of obligate intracellular parasites using standard techniques, a physical map is being developed using PFGE. In addition to providing a means for determining gene loci, the physical maps provide a means for comparing genetic organization among the different strains of C. burnetii.

### 16092830
### Catalytic asymmetric ring opening of 2,3-substituted norbornenes with organometallic reagents: a new formal aza functionalization of cyclopentadiene.
### An unprecedented regioselective and anti stereoselective asymmetric ring opening of 1,3-cyclopentadiene-heterodienophile cycloadducts, including also 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptenes, with hard alkylmetals and copper-phosphoramidite catalysts, is reported. The induced ring opening, in conjunction with C-C bond formation, gives a catalytic and practical access to new heterofunctionalized cyclopentenes in an enantioenriched form (up to 86% ee).

### 7985843
### Mitochondrial genetic variation in European, African and Indian cattle populations.
### Mitochondrial DNA from representative animals of 13 different cattle breeds was assayed for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) to determine phylogenetic relationships and levels of variation among breeds; 16 different mitotypes were found, described by 20 polymorphisms. Within these 16 mitotypes two major lineages were apparent: an Afro-European and an Asian type. These were found to differ at over 2.3% of sites surveyed. None of the mitotypes found in the Asian lineage was detectable in the Afro-European lineage and vice versa. Within each of the major mitotypes there were no further significant differences within or among breeds. Using rates of mitochondrial evolution estimated from other species, the two lineages were estimated to have diverged between 575,000 and 1,150,000 years ago; well outside the 10,000 years bp timeframe postulated by a single domestication hypothesis. The results presented are concordant with those generated in other studies and provide strong evidence for an independent domestication of Asian Bos indicus. Furthermore, the grouping of all African indicine populations within the clade containing all Bos taurus lineages points to the hybrid origins of the humped cattle of that continent.

### 12803880
### C2-ceramide inhibits LPS-induced nitric oxide production in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells through down-regulating the activation of Akt.
### The effect of C(2)-ceramide, a membrane-permeable ceramide analogue, on nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells was studied. The non-toxic concentration of C(2)-ceramide inhibited LPS-induced NO production. It was due to the attenuated expression of the inducible type of NO synthase (iNOS). C(2)-ceramide did not influence the phosphorylation of a series of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in response to LPS. On the other hand, C(2)-ceramide down-regulated the phosphorylation of Akt in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, followed by the impairment of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation. Moreover, the Akt dominant-negative mutant inhibited LPS-induced NO production. C(2)-ceramide was suggested to inhibit LPS-induced NO production through down-regulating the activation of Akt.

### 16720097
### Psychiatric disorders in patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, with and without comorbid epilepsy.
### PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to describe similarities and differences in epidemiological, psychiatric and semiologic variables between patients with psychogenic none epileptic seizures (PNES) and comorbid epilepsy (mixed PNES), and patients with PNES without comorbid epilepsy (pure PNES). RESULTS: Forty-three patients with PNES diagnosed by Video-EEG were included. Twenty-four had pure PNES, and ninteen mixed PNES. Female population, age, duration of PNES, psychiatric institutionalization, psychopharmacotherapy, dissociative disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), were significantly higher in the pure PNES patients. Suicide attempts, antiepileptic therapy, conversive, affective and personality disorders were frequent in both groups. In the analysis of seizure semiology, the total lack of responsiveness was significantly higher in the mixed PNES group. CONCLUSIONS: Pure PNES patients showed similarities and differences in the psychiatric profile, with a greater prevalence of dissociative disorders and PTSD, factors related to psychiatric severity.

### 493877
### Biochemical studies in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.
### In order to find the basic defect in the Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS), biochemical studies of platelets and leucocytes were undertaken. Glutathione levels of platelets were normal and regeneration of GSH similar to controls occurred after incubation with diamide (a specific agent for GSH oxidation). Phospholipid and fatty acid composition of HPS platelets was normal. The amount of peroxides found in platelet membranes was not elevated. A subnormal aggregation with arachidonic acid could be obtained in PRP using a high concentration of arachidonic acid (2 mM), but normal malondialdehyde levels were measured, suggesting a normal prostaglandin synthesis in HPS platelets. Glutathion peroxidase and p-phenylenediamide-mediated peroxidase (PPD-peroxidase) were normal in leucocytes of 1 HPS patient. Lysosomal enzymes as far as investigated were normal.

### 16768700
### Solitary thyroid nodule: current management.
### Clinically, solitary thyroid nodules are common, being present in up to 50% of the elderly population. The majority are benign with thyroid cancer representing an uncommon clinical problem. Investigation should include careful history and examination and thyroid function tests. Toxic or autonomous nodules are rarely malignant and require radionuclide scan for assessment. If euthyroid, then fine needle biopsy provides direct specific information about the cytology of the nodule from which the histology can be inferred. Thyroid 'incidentalomas' are a common management problem. Non-palpable nodules greater than 1.0 to 1.5 cm represent an absolute indication to perform an ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy. An atypical fine needle biopsy mandates formal diagnostic excision. Because it is not possible to distinguish a follicular carcinoma from a follicular adenoma on cytological grounds alone, this category must simply be interpreted as indicating a follicular tumour and up to 20% will be malignant. Hemithyroidectomy via a 'collar' incision, with submission of the specimen to formal pathological examination, remains the standard of care, with completion total thyroidectomy for cancers other than low risk papillary cancer and 'minimally invasive' follicular cancer without vascular invasion. The issue of whether follicular adenomas can potentially develop into follicular carcinomas has yet to be satisfactorily resolved. The major challenge in the management of the solitary thyroid nodule remains the assessment as to which nodules require surgical excision and which can be followed conservatively.

### 1286497
### Reversal of central benzodiazepine effects by flumazenil after conscious sedation produced by intravenous diazepam. The Flumazenil in Intravenous Conscious Sedation with Diazepam Multicenter Study Group I.
### Flumazenil is a competitive benzodiazepine antagonist that rapidly reverses the residual effects of benzodiazepines following intravenous conscious sedation. In a double-blind, multicenter study, postoperative patients who had been sedated with intravenous diazepam were randomly allocated to receive intravenous doses of flumazenil (0.4 mg to 1 mg) or placebo. Levels of sedation and psychomotor impairment were evaluated prestudy, at baseline, and at 6 intervals from 5 to 180 minutes posttreatment. A global evaluation of effectiveness was made at the 5-minute assessment, and memory was assessed at the 180-minute assessment. Flumazenil (mean dose: 0.73 mg [7.3 ml]) was significantly more effective than placebo (mean dose: 8.9 ml) in reversing sedation, psychomotor impairment, and amnesia within 5 minutes after the start of administration. At the 5-minute posttreatment assessment, 84% of 102 flumazenil-treated patients (compared with 42% of 52 placebo-treated patients) experienced complete reversal of sedation. Ninety-two percent of 93 flumazenil-treated patients (compared with 41% of 46 placebo-treated patients) had normal psychomotor function. Reversal of amnesia at the 5-minute assessment was achieved in 75% of 101 flumazenil-treated patients and in 20% of 51 placebo-treated patients. Statistically significant differences between flumazenil and placebo were also observed at the 15-minute assessment. Thereafter there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups. Most (70%) flumazenil-treated patients exhibited no recurrence of sedation during the 180-minute assessment period. The most frequent adverse reaction in the flumazenil group was dizziness (6%). There were no serious adverse experiences related to the test drug. Flumazenil provided prompt, controlled reversal of residual effects, especially sedation, in the majority (84%) of patients recovering from intravenous conscious sedation induced by diazepam. For most (70%) of these flumazenil-treated patients, the reversal was maintained throughout the 180-minute assessment.

### 16288504
### Enantioselective synthesis of furo[2,3-b]furans, a spongiane diterpenoid substructure.
### [structure: see text] A short and enantioselective synthesis of cis-fused 5-oxofuro[2,3-b]furans, being found in many spongiane diterpenoid natural products, is reported starting from inexpensive methyl 2-furoate. Moreover, the acid-catalyzed rearrangement of the furo[2,3-b]furan framework A to B is observed for some derivatives, suggesting a simple connection between natural products differing in the absolute configuration of the 3a,6a ring junction.

### 9049885
### Treatment of pediatric low-grade gliomas with a nitrosourea-based multiagent chemotherapy regimen.
### Between March 9, 1984 and January 29, 1992, 42 children with newly diagnosed symptomatic or previously diagnosed progressive low-grade gliomas received outpatient chemotherapy as their primary treatment. This study was a single arm, phase II trial designed to estimate the time to tumor progression and toxicity of this regimen. Procarbazine, 6-thioguanine, and dibromodulcitol were given before lomustine (CCNU) and vincristine was given 1 and 3 weeks after CCNU. Patients were treated for six treatment cycles or until the tumor progressed, whichever came first. Twenty-three patients had juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, 11 had astrocytomas, one had oligodendroglioma, one had ganglioglioma, and six had radiographically diagnosed low-grade gliomas. The mean age of the patients was 5 years (median, 3 years). The median time to treatment failure was 132 weeks (95% confidence interval: 106, 186 weeks). Only eight patients have died the estimated 5-year survival rate is 78% (95% confidence interval, 60% 87%). There were two episodes of grade 4 neutropenia, and three episodes of grade 4 thrombocytopenia. This regimen was safe, able to be delivered in the outpatient setting, and produced prolonged periods of disease stabilization in children with low-grade gliomas.

### 11380192
### Fungal mediated decolorization of media containing procion dyes.
### An isolated fungus, Aspergillus foetidus was found to effectively decolorize media containing azo reactive dyes, namely Procion dyes, under aerobic conditions. The extent of colour removal was 90% within 48 h of growth of the fungus. The entire colour was found to be strongly bioadsorbed to the rapidly settling spherical fungal biomass pellets. Our investigations reveal that the process of decolorization is concomitant with the exponential growth phase of the fungus and has an obligate requirement for a biodegradable substrate such as glucose. Kinetic analyses of fungal decolorization indicate that the rates of colour uptake decrease to a significant extent with increasing initial concentrations of dye. The fungus was able to grow and decolorize media in the presence of 5 ppm of chromium and 1% sodium chloride. An alternate and cheaper carbon source such as starch supported the growth and decolorization process. These results suggest that the dye uptake process mediated by Aspergillus foetidus has a potential for large-scale treatment of textile mill discharges.

### 941570
### [Background and evoked activity of hypothalamic neurons during development in cats]
### In acute experiments on anaesthetized kittens, studies have been made on the background and the evoked activity of hypothalamic neurons elicited by sensory stimuli. It was shown that already from the 2nd day of postnatal life, it is possible to observe the background impulse activity of the neurons in the posterior hypothalamus. The evoked reactions to stimulation of the sciatic nerve were recorded at the 4-5th day of postnatal life. At early stages of ontogenesis, both phasic and tonic types of neuronal reactions are presented in the hypothalamus, the former being more frequent. To the end of the 3rd week, neuronal reactions in the hypothalamus do not reach definitive pattern.

### 8609903
### Unusual steroid specificity of the cell surface progesterone receptor on human sperm.
### The steroid specificity of the cell surface progesterone receptor in human sperm was examined with the use of progesterone, testosterone, and androstane analogues. Many compounds were shown to be more effective than progesterone at increasing intracellular free calcium concentration, e.g., 2 alpha-methyl-17beta-methoxy-5 alpha-androstan-3-one. Several testosterone analogues were demonstrated to be antagonists of progesterone, e.g., 9(11)-dehydro-2 alpha,17alpha-dimethyltestosterone. The synthetic potent progestigens, norethynodrel, cyproterone acetate, norethindrone, and megestrol acetate, were found to be only weak stimulators of the sperm cell surface receptor. Furthermore, these compounds were shown to antagonize the effect of progesterone to elevate intracellular free calcium concentration in sperm. It is known that progesterone and some of its analogues bind to the intracellular progesterone nuclear receptor via the alpha-face of the steroid molecule. In stark contrast, it was concluded from the analysis of the steroid analogues examined on human sperm in this study that intimate contact exists between the effective progesterone analogues and the sperm cell surface progesterone receptor across the beta-face of the steroid C/D-ring "upper" edge (C11, C12, and C17). Positioning of the C21 methyl group is also critical for efficacy, and recognition of the steroid A-ring seems not to be involved.

### 8134021
### Retinal differentiation from multipotential pineal cells of the embryonic quail.
### Pineal cells of the embryonic quail are multipotent stem cells which are able to differentiate in vitro into pigmented epithelial cells, lens cells and skeletal muscle fibers. Neuronal expression was added in this study in the repertory of differentiating potency of pineal cells. We used immunohistochemical methods to characterize neuronal properties with antibodies against serotonin, GABA, tyrosine hydroxylase and neuron-specific antigen (HPC-1) in addition to the enzyme histochemistry for acetylcholinesterase activity. Cells in the culture were found to be positively stained with these methods, suggesting that embryonic pineal cells are neuropotent to differentiate various types of neuronal cells. We have studied the culture conditions which favor increment of neuronal cells with extension of neuritic processes, and we have found that neuronal cells are maintained for quite a long period under suppressive conditions of DNA synthesis and under the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Suppression of DNA synthesis was achieved by the addition of aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha, in the medium. Time lapse videograph revealed two different cell types participated in neurogenesis; a minor population of small round cells and a major one of flat epithelial cells. Since embryonic quail pineal cells have been shown to differentiate into two types of photoreceptors, the present results show wider retinal potency of cell differentiation by embryonic pineal cells. The cessation of DNA synthesis as well as growth factor(s) may be positively involved in the mechanisms of determination and differentiation of pineal neurons.

### 10751611
### Mutation induction by mechanical irritation caused by uracil-induced urolithiasis in Big Blue rats.
### Some chronic mechanical irritations induce cancers, and it is speculated that mutations are induced by increased rate of cell proliferation caused by the irritation. In this study, it was investigated using chronic mechanical irritation to urothelium caused by urolithiasis, whether mutations are really induced by such cell proliferation or not. Male rats transgenic for lacI (Big Blue(R) rats), in which lacI mutations accumulated in tissue can be measured, were fed 3% uracil, a component of RNA, to induce urolithiasis associated with papillomatosis, and eventually with bladder cancers. The frequency of independent mutations in the bladders of the treated rats showed 3-5 fold increases at weeks 10, 20, and 51 (P=0.01 at week 51) while the frequency was not elevated at week 2. The mutation frequencies in the control bladders ranged from 3 to 9x10(-6). In both groups, G to A transitions at CpG sites, indicative of spontaneous mutations, constituted the most prevalent mutations. Mechanical irritation caused by uracil was shown to induce a 3-5 fold increase of mutations, possibly through an elevation of spontaneous mutations by vigorous cell proliferation.

### 12114570
### Targeting tryptophan decarboxylase to selected subcellular compartments of tobacco plants affects enzyme stability and in vivo function and leads to a lesion-mimic phenotype.
### Tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes an early step of the terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthetic pathway by decarboxylation of L-tryptophan to produce the protoalkaloid tryptamine. In the present study, recombinant TDC was targeted to the chloroplast, cytosol, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants to evaluate the effects of subcellular compartmentation on the accumulation of functional enzyme and its corresponding enzymatic product. TDC accumulation and in vivo function was significantly affected by the subcellular localization. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that chloroplast-targeted TDC had improved accumulation and/or stability when compared with the cytosolic enzyme. Because ER-targeted TDC was not detectable by immunoblot analysis and tryptamine levels found in transient expression studies and in transgenic plants were low, it was concluded that the recombinant TDC was most likely unstable if ER retained. Targeting TDC to the chloroplast stroma resulted in the highest accumulation level of tryptamine so far reported in the literature for studies on heterologous TDC expression in tobacco. However, plants accumulating high levels of functional TDC in the chloroplast developed a lesion-mimic phenotype that was probably triggered by the relatively high accumulation of tryptamine in this compartment. We demonstrate that subcellular targeting may provide a useful strategy for enhancing accumulation and/or stability of enzymes involved in secondary metabolism and to divert metabolic flux toward desired end products. However, metabolic engineering of plants is a very demanding task because unexpected, and possibly unwanted, effects may be observed on plant metabolism and/or phenotype.

### 7083394
### Formation of 6-dimethylcarbamyloxy-dGuo, 6-dimethylamino-dGuo and 4-dimethylamino-dThd following in vitro reaction of dimethylcarbamyl chloride with calf thymus DNA and 6-diethylcarbamyloxy-dGuo following in vitro reaction of diethylcarbamyl chloride with calf thymus DNA.
### The rodent carcinogens dimethylcarbamyl chloride (DMCC) and diethylcarbamyl chloride (DECC) react with dGuo (pH 7.0-7.5, 37 degrees C, 4 h) to form the O6-acyl derivatives 6-dimethylcarbamyloxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (6-DMC-dGuo) and 6-diethylcarbamyloxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (6-DEC-dGuo), respectively. Reaction of DMCC with dThd under identical conditions yielded 4-dimethylamino-thymidine (4-DMA-dThd). Compounds 6-DMC-dGuo and 6-DEC-dGuo undergo a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction with dimethylamine (DMA) to form 6-dimethylamino-2'-deoxyguanosine (6-DMA-dGuo) via displacement of the C-6 dialkylcarbamyloxy moiety. The substitution reaction did not take place when diethylamine or NH3 were substituted for DMA. The structures of the new compounds 6-DMC-dGuo, 6-DEC-dGuo, 4-DMA-dThd and 6-DMA-dGuo were deduced from chemical analyses and syntheses, UV and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and electron impact, isobutane chemical ionization and source insertion isobutane chemical ionization mass spectra. It was postulated that 4-DMA-dThd was formed following reaction of the transient intermediate 4-DMC-dThd with DMA formed by hydrolysis of DMCC. Calf thymus DNA was reacted in vitro with DMCC (pH 7.0-7.5, 37 degrees C, 4 h) and the modified DNA hydrolyzed enzymatically to 2'-deoxynucleosides. Compounds 6-DMC-dGuo, 4-DMA-dThd and 6-DMA-dGuo were identified in the hydrolysate by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). In an identical manner 6-DEC-dGuo was identified following in vitro reaction of DECC with calf thymus DNA. Compounds 6-DEC-dGuo and 6-DMC-dGuo possess novel structures with respect to the types of adducts known to be formed between carcinogens and bases in DNA. The implications of these findings with respect to chemical mutagenesis and carcinogenesis is discussed. The structural relationship between N4-dimethyl-5-methylcytosine (4-dimethylamino-Thy) formed in DNA following in vitro reaction with DMCC and 5-methylcytosine, the only modified base found in vertebrate DNA is noted.

### [MRT in osteomyelitis: detection of bone sequestration with Gd-DTPA]
### In 4/12 patients with subacute or chronic osteomyelitis MRI was able to detect bone sequestrae by use of gadolinium DTPA. This method is of great advantage in cases of infections not originating from osteosynthetic material. In patients in whom osteosynthetic material was removed completely, invisible metallic residuals may lead to signal deterioration.

### 2532605
### The effect of anticholinergic and beta-agonist pretreatment on bronchoconstriction induced by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine.
### N-Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), an acylated tripeptide bacterial neutrophil chemotactic factor, has been shown to be a bronchoconstrictor by inhalation in man in vivo. It thus has a putative role in the generation of bronchoconstriction associated with bacterial bronchial infection. We have investigated the effect of pretreatment with the anticholinergic agent, ipratropium bromide (IB), and the beta 2-agonist, fenoterol (F), on FMLP-induced bronchoconstriction. Ten non-asthmatic subjects aged 21-28 yrs performed dose-response curves to nebulized FMLP on 3 study days after pretreatment with saline, F or IB. Amongst the 8 subjects who bronchoconstricted by 20% to FMLP there was a significant increase in the provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (PC20FMLP) after both IB and F. F was significantly better than IB. When comparison was made using absolute fall in FEV1 and including all 10 subjects the same results were found. Partial inhibition of FMLP-induced bronchoconstriction by IB suggests that part of the effect of FMLP is vagally mediated. We suggest that F is acting via modulation of FMLP-induced rises in intracellular free calcium.

### 3280821
### Doppler ultrasound of twin transfusion syndrome.
### Doppler sonography of umbilical arteries was used to evaluate eight cases of twin transfusion syndrome (TTS). Data were collected regarding the Doppler and real-time sonographic evaluation, clinical course, and outcome. In addition, the literature was reviewed. An abnormal peak systolic velocity (A) to end diastolic velocity (B) ratio, as defined by Giles et al, was seen in at least one twin in five cases. A difference in the A/B ratios between the two twins was greater than 0.4 in all eight cases. Doppler studies were able to suggest which fetus was encountering greater placental resistance, however they could not differentiate donor from recipient or provide prognostic data regarding outcome. Doppler evaluation was helpful when there was uncertainty as to whether growth discrepancy in a twin pregnancy was significant enough to suggest a pathologic state. In the future, Doppler sonography may be helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of therapy in TTS. Variable Doppler findings confirm that TTS is an extremely complex dynamic physiologic state.

### 1081578
### Fc-receptors, Ia-antigens, and immunoglobulin on normal and activated mouse T lymphocytes.
### Using antibody coated bovine erythrocytes we were unable to demonstrate Fc-receptors on either thymus cells or T cells prepared from lymph node cell suspensions by anti-Ig column filtration. However, if parental thymus or lymph node T cells were transferred to X-irradiated F1 hybrids, activated donor T cells recovered from the recipient's spleen (ATC-spleen) were shown to express Fc-receptors. Fc-receptors were also demonstrable on ATC-spleen prepared between strain combinations differing at the M-locus. In marked contrast, Fc-receptors were not detected on ATC recovered from thoracic duct lymph (T.TDL). This applied to (a) H-2-activated T.TDL derived from normal thymus cells, (b) H-2-activated T.TDL derived from thymus cells depleted of B cells, and (c) M-locus-activated T.TDL. Of these three populations, surface Ig (of B cell origin) was detected on a large proportion of the first but not on the second and third populations. Thus, the failure to detect Fc-receptors on any of these populations could not be attributed to blocking by adsorbed surface Ig. In addition, various T-cell populations were examined by a microcytotoxicity assay for the presence of cell surface Ia-antigens. 5--10% of the thymus cells, 20--30% of cortisone-resistant thymus cells, 60--70% of lymph node cells, and 60--80% of ATC-spleen and T.TDL showed Ia.

### Canine neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas: a study using image analysis techniques for the discrimination of metastatic versus nonmetastatic tumors.
### Canine pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors were studied using different image analysis techniques (nuclear image histometry, analysis of argyrophilic proteins of nucleolar organizer regions, determination of the mouse anti-Ki 67 antigen proliferation index, and DNA densitometry) to correlate their biological behavior with objective phenotypic markers. The methods were compared to determine the best method for distinguishing between metastatic and nonmetastatic tumors. Discrimination between the two types of tumor was possible using nuclear image histometry in combination with morphometric analysis of argyrophilic proteins of nucleolar organizer regions. In contrast, the mouse anti-Ki 67 antigen proliferation index, DNA measurement, and immunohistochemical parameters revealed no significant difference between the two types of tumors.

### [Perioperative mortality and the role of anesthesiologic activity at the Vrije University Hospital in Amsterdam]
### OBJECTIVE: To determine the perioperative mortality and the share of anaesthesiological activity in it. DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive. SETTING: VU University Hospital, Amsterdam. METHOD: Patients who in the period 1989-1994 had died within 7 days after a clinical surgical intervention were identified using the database of the hospital information system. The following data concerning these patients were collected from the database of the department of Anaesthesiology: age, sex, classification according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), urgency (elective or emergency operation), type of operation (12 categories), duration of the operation, time and place of death. Four independent investigators classified the deceased patients with the aid of their medical files as to the degree of connection between the anaesthesiological activity and the death according to the Edwards classification. RESULTS: A total of 62,969 operations had been performed. following which 314 patients (0.5%) had died within 7 days. Death was connected with the anaesthesiological activity in 16 cases (2.5 per 10,000 operations): there was a connection with the anaesthesiological activity exclusively in two patients (0.3 per 10,000 operations) and with both anaesthesiological and surgical factors in 14 patients (2.2 per 10,000 operations). Advanced age, male sex, a higher ASA category, traumatological operations and emergency operations were associated with a higher mortality rate. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate within 7 days after a clinical surgical intervention was 0.5%. A connection with anaesthesiological activity was present in 2.5 per 10,000 operations.

### 3818591
### Assembly of the alpha-toxin-hexamer of Staphylococcus aureus in the liposome membrane.
### It has been shown that the access of the alpha-toxin of Staphylococcus aureus to the target membrane and assembly of the hexamer can be monitored independently by respectively measuring the fluorescence energy transfer from the tryptophan residue(s) of the toxin to the dansylated phosphatidylethanolamine in the liposome membrane and the fluorescence increment of the toxin at 336 nm (Ikigai, H., and Nakae, T., (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2150-2155). Measurement of these parameters under various conditions showed the following results: when phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes composed of saturated fatty acids were mixed with the toxin, the fluorescence energy transfer occurred below, at, and above the transition temperature of the lipid, but the change of fluorescence at 336 nm was never detectable; when PC-liposomes containing unsaturated fatty acids were used, both the fluorescence energy transfer and the fluorescence increment of 336 nm were observed. These results suggested that the toxin-membrane interaction occurs in PC-membranes containing saturated and/or unsaturated fatty acids and that the oligomerization occurs only in the presence of PC containing unsaturated fatty acid(s). This conclusion was supported by the results of quantitative determination of the toxin-hexamer assembly and leakage of carboxyfluorescein from PC-liposomes under conditions similar to the above.

### 2449067
### Innervation of the superficial pineal of the rat using retrograde tracing methods.
### Fast blue (FB), rhodamine microspheres (RH), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (WGA-HRP) were used as retrograde tracers to study the innervation of the rat superficial pineal gland (SP). One of the tracers was injected into the gland of each animal. All four retrograde tracers injected into the gland always labeled neurons in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG). No retrograde labeling was ever seen in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, habenular nuclei, amygdalar nuclei, or superior salivatory nuclei. Retrograde labeling was seen in the anterior hypothalamic nuclei, anterior thalamic nuclei, lateral geniculate bodies, and midbrain tectal structures when a tracer spread from the injection site to the overlying cortex, tectum, or commissures. Control studies included injection of tracer into the subarachnoid space around the SP or into structures adjacent to the SP. Only the injection of FB or WGA-HRP into the subarachnoid space labeled neurons in the SCG. This labeling was probably due to the spread of tracer to the choroid plexus. These results agree with recent work confirming the existence of a direct projection of the SCG into the interstitium around pinealocytes. The evidence does not substantiate an innervation originating in the habenular nuclei; the superior salivatory nuclei; or any other diencephalic, midbrain, pontine, or medullary structure.

### 12452506
### Hospital-acquired infections in the neonatal intensive care unit--Klebsiella pneumoniae.
### Klebsiella pneumoniae is medically the most important organism of the Klebsiella species. It is responsible for a significant proportion of hospital-acquired infections including septicemias, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and soft tissue infections especially in the immunocompromised hosts such as the neonate. The hands of healthcare workers and the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized infants serve as reservoirs for the transmission of the organism and are responsible for multiple hospital outbreaks. In recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of outbreaks caused by multidrug resistance K. pneumoniae organisms or the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae. The problems associated with extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms include difficulties in accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing, limited treatment options and increased morbidity and perhaps mortality. Hence, prevention through implementation of strict infection control guidelines, effective hand washing and judicious use of antimicrobials such as third generation cephalosporins is important to effectively reduce the morbidity associated with this infection.

### 17949441
### High diversity of Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive, methicillin-susceptible isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and implications for the evolution of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
### In total, 100 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from diverse cases of skin and soft-tissue infection at a university hospital in Saxony, Germany, were characterised using diagnostic microarrays. Virulence factors, including Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), were detected and the isolates were assigned to clonal groups. Thirty isolates were positive for the genes encoding PVL. Only three PVL-positive methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates were found, two of which belonged to European clone ST80-MRSA IV and one to USA300 strain ST8-MRSA IV. The remaining methicillin-susceptible PVL-positive isolates belonged to a variety of different multilocus sequence types. The predominant strains were agrI/ST22, agrII/CC5, agrIII/CC30 and agrIV/ST121. In order to check for possible bias caused by regional or local outbreak strains, an additional 18 methicillin-susceptible, PVL-positive isolates from the UK were tested. Approximately two-thirds of the UK isolates belonged to types that also comprised approximately two-thirds of the isolates from Saxony. Some methicillin-susceptible PVL-positive isolates (agrI/ST152, agrIII/ST80 and agrIII/ST96) closely resembled known epidemic community-acquired MRSA (CaMRSA) strains. These findings indicate that the current rise in PVL-positive CaMRSA could be caused by the dissemination of novel SCCmec elements among pre-existing PVL-positive strains, rather than by the spread of PVL phages among MRSA strains.

### Children's perceptions of peers with AIDS: assessing the impact of contagion information, perceived similarity, and illness conceptualization.
### Assessed factors that affected acceptance of a hypothetical peer with AIDS. Children in Grades 4-6 read vignettes containing one of four levels of contagion information and one of two levels of perceived similarity. Illness conceptualization was measured as a continuous variable. Results indicated that the type of AIDS information given to children affected their perception of the peer. Specifically, informing children about the modes of HIV transmission was not sufficient to increase acceptance, but clearing misconceptions by describing ways HIV is not transmitted positively affected children's reactions to the peer. No other significant results were found. Results of the current study have clear and practical implications for AIDS education programs in schools.

### 15566583
### Effect of lung compliance and endotracheal tube leakage on measurement of tidal volume.
### INTRODUCTION: The objective of this laboratory study was to measure the effect of decreased lung compliance and endotracheal tube (ETT) leakage on measured exhaled tidal volume at the airway and at the ventilator, in a research study with a test lung. METHODS: The subjects were infant, adult and pediatric test lungs. In the test lung model, lung compliances were set to normal and to levels seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Set tidal volume was 6 ml/kg across a range of simulated weights and ETT sizes. Data were recorded from both the ventilator light-emitting diode display and the CO2SMO Plus monitor display by a single observer. Effective tidal volume was calculated from a standard equation. RESULTS: In all test lung models, exhaled tidal volume measured at the airway decreased markedly with decreasing lung compliance, but measurement at the ventilator showed minimal change. In the absence of a simulated ETT leak, calculation of the effective tidal volume led to measurements very similar to exhaled tidal volume measured at the ETT. With a simulated ETT tube leak, the effective tidal volume markedly overestimated tidal volume measured at the airway. CONCLUSION: Previous investigators have emphasized the need to measure tidal volume at the ETT for all children. When ETT leakage is minimal, it seems from our simulated lung models that calculation of effective tidal volume would give similar readings to tidal volume measured at the airway, even in small patients. Future studies of tidal volume measurement accuracy in mechanically ventilated children should control for the degree of ETT leakage.

### Fibroproliferative disorder of the antrum after an alkali ingestion.
### We describe a 2 1/2-yr-old Chinese boy who ingested potassium carbonate solution and presented with gastric outlet obstruction. He underwent successful antral resection. A severe fibroproliferative process of the antral submucosa obliterating the lumen was found to be the cause of this gastric outlet obstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing such a fibroproliferative process of the stomach.

### Arterial baroreflex sensitivity, plasma catecholamines, and pressor responsiveness in essential hypertension.
### Arterial baroreflex sensitivity, plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), and pressor and depressor responses were assessed in 25 patients with essential hypertension and 29 normotensive control subjects. Sensitivity of the cardiac limb of the baroreflex was determined by blood pressure and interbeat interval responses associated with the Valsalva maneuver, externally applied neck suction and pressure, and injection of phenylephrine and nitroglycerin. By all these techniques, patients with essential hypertension had significantly decreased baroreflex sensitivity, even after adjustment for age mismatching between the hypertensive and normotensive groups. Hypertensive patients also had significantly higher mean levels of plasma NE and E in both brachial arterial and antecubital venous blood (246 vs 154 pg/ml arterial NE, 286 vs 184 pg/ml venous NE, 99 vs 55 pg/ml arterial E, and 65 vs 35 pg/ml venous E) and significantly larger pressor responses to injected phenylephrine (30.9 mm Hg/100 micrograms vs 16.7 mm Hg/100 micrograms). When baroreflex-cardiac sensitivity values measured by the various techniques were averaged, there was a significant inverse relationship between sensitivity and venous NE and between sensitivity and pressor responsiveness. The results indicate that decreased baroreflex-cardiac sensitivity, increased sympathetic outflow, and pressor hyperresponsiveness tend to occur together in some patients with essential hypertension. Decreased arterial distensibility and altered central neural integration can account for these findings.

### Effect of DL111-IT on progesterone biosynthesis and viability of rat luteal cells in vitro.
### AIM: To study the influence of DL111-IT on progesterone biosynthesis of cultured luteal cells (LC). METHODS: LC viability was assessed with trypan blue dye exclusion and progesterone concentration was measured with radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: DL111-IT decreased the viability of LC after 24-h incubation, its ED50 being 7.7 (95% confidence limits: 7.1-8.5) mg.L-1. DL111-IT inhibited basal secretion of progesterone in a concentration-dependent manner, and 3 mg.L-1 decreased progesterone concentration by 25% vs control. DL111-IT 3 mg.L-1 also inhibited the stimulatory effect of forskolin (cAMP activator) 10 mumol.L-1 and pregnenolone [converted to progesterone by 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-isomerase complex (3 beta-HSD)] 10 mumol.L-1 on progesterone production in cultured LC, and their inhibitory rates were 43% and 155%, respectively. At the same concentration, DL111-IT did not influence hCG-induced progesterone production. CONCLUSION: DL111-IT inhibited progesterone synthesis by suppressing the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone (inactivating 3 beta-HSD) and suppressed the activity of cAMP. DL111-IT 6-24 mg.L-1 decreased the viability of LC.

### 8254914
### [Multiple myeloma associated with diffuse parenchymal amyloidosis of the lung]
### A 58-year-old woman was hospitalized in March, 1991, with slight breathlessness on exertion. Laboratory investigations revealed M-protein (IgG lambda type, 7,575mg/dl) in serum, and Bence-Jones proteinuria. Osteolytic bone lesions were noted roentgeno-logically. Bone marrow aspiration showed the presence of 19% of atypical plasma cells, and the case was diagnosed as multiple myeloma. The chest X-ray film showed bilateral diffuse micronodules, which were found by a transbronchial lung biopsy to be diffuse parenchymal amyloid deposits. The patient was treated with melphalan, prednisolone and interferon-alpha for 6 courses. Clinical symptoms improved but no decrease of the level of M-protein was observed. The patient is still alive without changes of pulmonary shadows on X-ray films for the past 2 years.

### 15318023
### A survey of coccidian infection of freshwater fishes in South Africa, with the description of Goussia anopli n. sp. (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae).
### Seventy-seven specimens of seven freshwater fish species harvested in four sites from rivers and ponds of the Gauteng, North West and Limpopo Provinces (South Africa) were surveyed for coccidian infections. Two fish species were infected with apicomplexans belonging to Goussia Labb, 1896. In banded tilapia Tilapia sparrmanii Smith unsporulated ocysts of G. vanasi (Landsberg & Paperna, 1987) were found which became sporulated in tap-water within 24 hours. Another species in the gut of chubbyhead barb Barbus anoplus Weber harboured sporulated ocysts in the faeces and in the intestinal epithelium. The latter species has been described as G. anopli n. sp.

### 7388185
### Indirect evidence for the importance of steady-state [K]o in determining the extent of the effects of hyperpolarizing electrogenesis on vascular smooth muscle reactivity.
### Abruptly increasing [K]o and adding ouabain produce short-term depression and enhancement, respectively, of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) reactivity, presumably as a result of stimulating and inhibiting, respectively, hyperpolarizing electrogenesis. Moreover, the presence of a steady-state level of electrogenesis is implicated by the enhancing effect of ouabain. The results of this study indicate that the extent of these short-term changes in electrogenesis and the level of this steady-state electrogenesis are regulated by small changes in steady-state [K]o within a physiological range, 3--6 mM.

### 2695276
### Metabolic considerations in the treatment of the black hypertensive.
### Hypertension and its cardiovascular consequences are both common and potentially devastating among black Americans. Recent evidence suggests that not all antihypertensive agents have similar efficacy in hypertensive patients, nor do all convey the same benefit in terms of reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. This review considers the efficacy of various antihypertensive agents in blacks, with particular reference to the impact of these agents on cardiovascular disease risk factors and on associated diseases often encountered in black hypertensives. Emphasis is placed on the use of therapeutic approaches other than diuretics alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents from the vantage point of efficacy and enhancement of cardiovascular and metabolic benefits.

### Pulmonary vascular changes induced by congenital obstruction of pulmonary venous return.
### BACKGROUND: Pulmonary venous obstruction (PVO) induces pulmonary arterial hypertension, as well as pulmonary venous hypertension, and jeopardizes the repair of cardiac lesions. METHODS: Four cases of congenital mitral stenosis and 4 cases of cor triatriatum (Lucas type A), ages ranging from 2 months to 16 years, were histologically examined on pulmonary vasculature. Histometrical analysis was performed on medial thickness and intimal changes of both pulmonary arteries and veins. For comparison, the examination of pulmonary vasculature in ventricular septal defect (VSD) cases was also performed. RESULTS: Medial thickening and intimal fibrosis, in both pulmonary arteries and veins with widespread lymphangiectasia, were characteristic vascular changes of PVO cases. Medial thickness of pulmonary arteries was correlated with preoperative pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) (r = 0.77, p = 0.03 for systolic PAP), and greater than that of VSD cases. Medial thickness of pulmonary veins was also greater in PVO cases. Intimal fibrosis of pulmonary arteries and veins was seen extensively at the advanced ages, whereas no plexiform lesions or more advanced stages of pulmonary vascular disease were present. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital PVO induced progressive medial thickening and intimal fibrosis in pulmonary arteries and veins accompanied by lymphangiectasia. However, no plexiform lesions or more advanced stages of pulmonary vascular disease were present, which may explain the reversibility of pulmonary hypertension due to congenital PVO.

### Plasmalemmal KATP channels shape triggered calcium transients in metabolically impaired rat atrial myocytes.
### The relative role of plasmalemmal and mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels in calcium homeostasis of the atrium is little understood. Electrically triggered (1 Hz) cytoplasmic calcium transients were measured by 340-to-380-nm wavelength fura 2 emission ratios in cultured rat atrial myocytes. CCCP, a mitochondrial protonophore (100-400 nmol/l), dose dependently reduced the transient amplitude by up to 85%, caused a slow rise in baseline calcium, and reduced the recovery time constant of the transient from 143 to 91 ms (P < 0.05). However, neither 5-hydroxydecanoate, a mitochondrial K(ATP) channel blocker, nor diazoxide (500 micromol/l) affected the amplitude, baseline, or time constant in CCCP-treated cells. HMR-1098 (30 micromol/l), a plasmalemmal K(ATP) channel blocker, and glibenclamide (1 micromol/l) increased the amplitude in CCCP-treated myocytes by 69-82%, sharply elevated the calcium baseline, and prolonged the recovery time constant to 181-193 ms (P < 0.01). Thus opening of plasmalemmal but not mitochondrial K(ATP) channels reduces the calcium overload in metabolically compromised but otherwise intact atrial myocytes. Mitochondrial K(ATP) channels probably operate through a different mechanism to afford ischemic protection.

### Cytoplasmic domains in eggs.
### One way of organizing the body plan of a developing embryo is to establish domains in the egg with distinct compositions in defined spatial relationships to one another: when the egg divides up, these domains segregate preferentially to certain regions of the embryo and influence their development. In this review we discuss the nature, formation and reorganization of distinguishable domains in various eggs.

### Correlation between strong adjuvanticity of Klebsiella O3 lipopolysaccharide and its ability to induce interleukin-1 secretion.
### Adjuvant activity of Klebsiella O3 lipopolysaccharide (KO3 LPS) in augmenting antibody response and delayed-type hypersensitivity to protein antigens in SMA mice was much stronger than that of LPS from Escherichia coli O55 and O127 (EO55 LPS and EO127 LPS). Relationship between strength of the adjuvant activity and that of the ability to induce interleukin-1 (IL-1) secretion by peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeN or SMA mice was investigated using these three kinds of LPS. When supernatant samples of macrophages cultured at 37 degrees C for 24 hr in the presence of 5 micrograms/ml LPS were assayed by their mitogenic effect on thymocytes from C3H/HeJ mice, KO3 LPS induced the secretion of about four to six times greater amounts of IL-1 activity than did EO127 LPS. When concentration of LPS used for stimulation of macrophages was varied from 0.1 to 50 micrograms/ml, KO3 LPS induced the secretion of definitely greater amounts of IL-1 activity than did EO55 LPS and EO127 LPS throughout the LPS concentrations tested. Nearly the same amount of IL-1 activity as that produced by 10 micrograms/ml EO55 LPS or 50 micrograms/ml EO127 LPS could be produced by 1.0 microgram/ml or lower concentrations of KO3 LPS.

### 11907212
### Human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early proteins and simian virus 40 large T antigen can inhibit apoptosis through activation of the phosphatidylinositide 3'-OH kinase pathway and the cellular kinase Akt.
### The temperature-sensitive cell line ts13 is mutated in CCG1, the gene encoding TAF(II)250, the largest of the TATA-binding protein-associated factors (TAFs) in TFIID. At the nonpermissive temperature, the temperature-sensitive phenotypes are (i) transcription defects, (ii) cell cycle arrest in G(1), and (iii) apoptosis. We previously demonstrated that the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major immediate-early proteins (MIEPs) can rescue the transcription defects and inhibit apoptosis at the nonpermissive temperature. In the work presented, we show that activation of the cellular kinase Akt alone can inhibit apoptosis in ts13 cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature. More significantly, we show that the HCMV MIEPs can activate Akt, resulting in the inhibition of apoptosis. In parallel experiments, we found that simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen can mediate the same function. These experiments were done by transfecting the HCMV major immediate-early gene or a cDNA encoding T antigen into ts13 cells, and thus neither viral attachment to receptors, viral tegument proteins, nor any other viral protein is required for Akt activation. Akt is activated by the phosphatidylinositide 3'-OH (PI3) kinase pathway. Using a specific inhibitor of PI3 kinase, we show that the ability of the MIEPs and T antigen to activate Akt and inhibit apoptosis is eliminated, suggesting that the viral proteins utilize the PI3 kinase pathway for Akt activation. Transfection of plasmids which express the individual 86-kDa (IEP86; IE2(579aa)) and 72-kDa (IEP72; IE1(491aa)) MIEPs indicate that each MIEP could inhibit apoptosis via activation of the PI3 kinase pathway.

### 12238847
### Glucocorticoids reduce ischemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial apoptosis in immature hearts.
### BACKGROUND: Transient myocardial dysfunction often occurs after ischemia-reperfusion with immature myocardium appearing particularly susceptible. Neutrophil adhesion and activation contribute to ischemia-reperfusion injury after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), possibly resulting in cell death. The hypothesis was that glucocorticoids could prevent reperfusion-induced myocardial dysfunction by blunting leukocyte-mediated injury. METHODS: Neonatal piglets were cooled with CPB followed by 2 hours of circulatory arrest. Animals were rewarmed, removed from CPB, and allowed to recover for 2 hours. Methylprednisolone (60 mg/kg) was administered in the CPB priming solution to one group (intraoperative glucocorticoids). In another group (preoperative glucocorticoids), 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone was administered 6 hours before CPB in addition to the intraoperative dose (30 mg/kg). Control animals received no glucocorticoids. RESULTS: Apoptotic myocardial cells measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay and caspase-3 activity were reduced in animals administered glucocorticoids compared with controls (p < 0.05). Animals receiving either intraoperative or preoperative glucocorticoids had 0.10 +/- 0.07 and 0.13 +/- 0.05 apoptotic cells per high-power field, respectively, whereas 0.33 +/- 0.15 apoptotic cells were detected with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling in control animals. Glucocorticoid administration reduced myocardial intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA expression compared with control piglets. Maximum rate of increase of left ventricular pressure was 62% +/- 9% of baseline in control animals at 120 minutes of recovery compared with 96% +/- 6% and 95% +/- 10% of baseline in animals receiving intraoperative and preoperative glucocorticoids, respectively (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of neutrophil adhesion and activation proteins in neonatal myocardium was associated with less apoptotic cell death after glucocorticoid administration. The blunting of apoptosis in glucocorticoid-treated animals was also associated with improved recovery of left ventricular systolic function in neonatal animals after CPB and circulatory arrest. Glucocorticoid attenuation of myocardial apoptosis might have important implications for maintaining long-term ventricular function after ischemia and reperfusion.

### 7730265
### Molecular cloning of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase from Kluyveromyces lactis: a single nucleotide substitution in the gene confers ethidium bromide resistance and deficiency in K+ uptake.
### A Kluyveromyces lactis strain resistant to ethidium bromide and deficient in potassium uptake was isolated. Studies on the proton-pumping activity of the mutant strain showed that a decreased H(+)-ATPase specific activity was responsible for the observed phenotypes. The putative K. lactis PMA1 gene encoding the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase was cloned by its ability to relieve the potassium transport defect of this mutant and by reversing its resistance to ethidium bromide. Its deduced amino acid sequence predicts a protein 899 residues long that is structurally colinear in its full length to H(+)-ATPases cloned from different yeasts, except for the presence of a variable N-terminal domain. By PCR-mediated amplification, we identified a transition from G to A that rendered the substitution of the fully conserved methionine at position 699 by isoleucine. We attribute to this amino acid change the low capacity of the mutant H(+)-ATPase to pump out protons.

### 15955820
### Varicella-zoster virus IE63 protein phosphorylation by roscovitine-sensitive cyclin-dependent kinases modulates its cellular localization and activity.
### During the first stage of Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) infection, IE63 (immediate early 63 protein) is mostly expressed in the nucleus and also slightly in the cytoplasm, and during latency, IE63 localizes in the cytoplasm quite exclusively. Because phosphorylation is known to regulate various cellular mechanisms, we investigated the impact of phosphorylation by roscovitine-sensitive cyclin-dependent kinase (RSC) on the localization and functional properties of IE63. We demonstrated first that IE63 was phosphorylated on Ser-224 in vitro by CDK1 and CDK5 but not by CDK2, CDK7, or CDK9. Furthermore, by using roscovitine and CDK1 inhibitor III (CiIII), we showed that CDK1 phosphorylated IE63 on Ser-224 in vivo. By mutagenesis and the use of inhibitors, we demonstrated that phosphorylation on Ser-224 was important for the correct localization of the protein. Indeed, the substitution of these residues by alanine led to an exclusive nuclear localization of the protein, whereas mutations into glutamic acid did not modify its subcellular distribution. When transfected or VZV-infected cells were treated with roscovitine or CiIII, an exclusive nuclear localization of IE63 was also observed. By using a transfection assay, we also showed that phosphorylation on Ser-224 and Thr-222 was essential for the down-regulation of the basal activity of the VZV DNA polymerase gene promoter. Similarly, roscovitine and CiIII impaired these properties of the wild-type form of IE63. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of CDK1-mediated IE63 phosphorylation for a correct distribution of IE63 between both cellular compartments and for its repressive activity toward the promoter tested.

### 14630446
### Lyme borreliosis.
### Lyme borreliosis is the most common tick-transmitted disease in the northern hemisphere and is caused by spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi species complex. A complete presentation of the disease is an extremely unusual observation in which a skin lesion results from a tick bite and is followed by heart and nervous system involvement, and later on by arthritis. Late involvement of eye, nervous system, joints, and skin can also occur. The only sign that enables a reliable clinical diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is erythema migrans. Other features of some diagnostic value are earlobe lymphocytoma, meningoradiculoneuritis (Garin-Bujadoux-Bannwarth syndrome), and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. The many other symptoms and signs have little diagnostic value. Microbial or serological confirmation of borrelial infection is needed for all manifestations of the disease except for typical early skin lesions. However, even erythema migrans might not be pathognomonic for Lyme borreliosis, especially in the southern part of the USA where there is no microbiological evidence for infection with the agent. Treatment with antibiotics is beneficial for all stages of Lyme borreliosis, but is most successful early in the course of the illness. Prevention relies mainly on avoiding exposure to tick bites but there is some interest in chemoprophylaxis and also in vaccine development following initial disappointments.

### 7846149
### Construction of a versatile promoter analysis vector and its use for analysis of the Serratia marcescens aspartase promoter region.
### A new versatile promoter analysis vector, pLGlacZ7, which contains a multiple cloning site and the lacZ structural gene in a low-copy-number plasmid pLG339, has been constructed. This plasmid, which can be stably maintained in Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens, is useful for analysis of gene expression using lacZ gene fusions. The multiple cloning site of pLGlacZ7 is convenient for the insertion or deletion of promoter DNA fragments, the latter by using exonuclease III. The promoter of the S. marcescens aspA gene encoding aspartase was analyzed using plasmid pLGlacZ7. The S. marcescens aspA gene is composed of 1434 nucleotides and codes for a protein with a Mr of 52,543 whose predicted amino acid sequence was very similar to that of the E. coli aspA gene product. Two functional regions that may participate in the transcription of the S. marcescens aspA gene were found in the promoter region by using lacZ gene fusions in pLGlacZ7.

### 1941302
### Health screening in elderly Oklahomans.
### A total of 550 males and 457 females in their 60s and 70s were screened for height and weight, blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, and hemoglobin. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software. Male values were abnormal for all screening parameters except for cholesterol. Statistically significant lower hemoglobin in males suggests that blood loss may be a problem, and in males increases in body weight and glucose may herald a higher frequency of cardiovascular disease. Control of blood pressure, weight reduction, decreased consumption of fat and salt, and regular exercise may be the health imperatives in this group of elderly Oklahomans.

### 293569
### Leptospirosis in meat inspectors: preliminary results of a serological survey.
### A serological survey of leptospirosis among more than 1000  meat inspectors, from meat works throughout New Zealand, revealed a serological prevalence at a minimum serum dilution of 1:24, of 10.2 percent. Eighty-five percent of serological reactions were to serovars pomona and tarassovi. A highly significant correlation was demonstrated between the serological prevalence of these serovars and the inspection of pigs. Evidence is provided to substantiate the use of titres as low as 1:24 as an indication of previous leptospiral infection. Forty-two inspectors reported medical evidence of previous clinical infection with leptospirosis. Analysis of those who still exhibited a serological response and their individual case histories, indicated that detectable titres of leptospirosis can exist for up to 10 years.

### 8921698
### [Bone mineral density of the calcanei dissected from 30 cadavers--correlation of the values measured by the DXA, QCT and USD methods]
### The bone mineral density (BMD) of calcanei dissected from 30 cadavers (14 males and 16 females; ages 61 to 100) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography (QCT), while the stiffness was measured by ultrasound bone densitometry (USD). There was high correlation between BMD by DXA and average bone density by QCT (R = 0.94), but poor correlation between BMD by DXA and stiffness by USD (R = 0.55). However, the correlation coefficient of stiffness to BMD was much higher in the female calcanei (R = 0.74) than in the male calcanei (R = 0.32). Analyzing the three elements, stiffness, speed of sound (SOS) and broad-band ultrasound attenuation (BUA), it was clear that SOS rather than stiffness correlated strongly to BMD by DXA and to bone density of trabeculated bones by QCT (R = 0.618; 0.699 respectively). The value of BUA shows more relationship to the width of the calcanei than the area of X-ray projection from the side (R = 0.561).

### 2980509
### The role of digital subtraction angiography in neuroradiology. An evaluation of intravenous and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography.
### A few years after the introduction of intravenous digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in clinical practice it became clear that, although the method had been developed as an alternative to arterial angiography, especially for the analysis of cerebral ischemia, its application was not as successful as the earlier reports had indicated. Based on the results of a study comparing intravenous DSA, intra-arterial DSA, and the Doppler examination, in 168 consecutive patients, a diagnostic algorithm for the management of these patients is proposed. A second and more important application of digital subtraction is its use with arterial angiography, especially with a high resolution system configuration.

### Actions of betahistine at histamine receptors in the brain.
### The actions of betahistine (N alpha-methyl-2-pyridylethylamine) on brain histamine receptors were investigated in a series of biological models. [3H]Mepyramine binding to H1-receptors in membranes from guinea-pig cerebellum was inhibited by betahistine with a Ki value of 31 microM. The binding of [3H]mepyramine in brain of the living mouse was inhibited by betahistine in high dosages (150-300 mg/kg). In slices from mouse cerebral cortex, betahistine induced [3H]glycogen hydrolysis in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 9.0 microM with a maximal effect 57% that of histamine. Mepyramine and triprolidine, two H1-receptor antagonists, inhibited the betahistine-induced glycogenolysis with Ki values of 28 nM and 7 nM respectively. In slices from guinea-pig hippocampus, betahistine stimulated the accumulation of cyclic AMP in the presence of 5 microM impromidine, a H2-receptor agonist. The maximal effect represented 22% of that elicited by histamine at the H1-receptor and the EC50 value was 32.4 microM. Mepyramine at 0.1 microM partially blocked the response to betahistine. Together these various observations indicate that betahistine is a partial agonist at cerebral H1-receptors. Finally, betahistine was not an agonist at histamine H3-autoreceptors but was a rather potent antagonist of the inhibitory effect of exogenous histamine on [3H]histamine release elicited by K+ depolarisation in slices from rat cerebral cortex (Ki = 6.9 microM).

### 12515445
### Electrophysiology of the frontal lobe.
### The electrophysiology of the frontal lobe appears to be unimpressive when the view is limited to the routine EEG recording of a healthy waking adult. There is usually low voltage fast activity, which becomes more pronounced when recorded with depth leads. Three special EEG patterns of marginal to slightly abnormal character are discussed: a) rhythmical midfrontal 6-7/sec activity of juveniles, b) rhythmical midfrontal sharp 4-6/sec activity of infancy and early childhood with arousal from sleep, and c) frontal intermittent rhythmical delta activity (FIRDA) in waking adults with frontopolar maximum, possibly related to thought processes under abnormal conditions. With extension of the frequency range, ultraslow (DC-like) as well as fast beta (gamma, 40-80/sec) and ultrafast activity (80-1000/sec) are found particularly over the frontal lobes. Ultraslow baseline shifts are arousal-related and mixed with overlying ultrafast waves. Attention control and the "working memory" involve chiefly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, investigated with P300 responses and likely to show ultrafast spectra. Perception-related 40-80/sec gamma activity has been thought to be associated with the entrance into consciousness. Initiation and design of motor activity spreads from prefrontal to the frontomotor cortex, associated with powerful event-related potentials: contingent negative variation (CNV) and "Bereitschafts potential" ("readiness potential," RP). Neuroscientific research of the highest frontal lobe functions has become a very active domain of neuroimaging. With the use of the extended frequency range, EEG and also evoked potential studies could add further information with acquisition in real time. Ultrafast frequency ranges presented in computerized frequency analysis and mapping might show impressive correlates of highest frontal lobe functions.

### Fibroblast growth factor 2 promotes pancreatic epithelial cell proliferation via functional fibroblast growth factor receptors during embryonic life.
### Several investigators have postulated that soluble growth factors are involved in the early development of the pancreas. In many tissues in which soluble factors are implicated in development, these factors act on their target cells through tyrosine kinase receptors. Because we had some preliminary evidence that fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) were expressed in the early pancreas, we investigated the effect of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) during embryonic pancreatic development. For that purpose, we first studied the distribution and the functionality of FGFRs during pancreatic organogenesis. FGFR1 and FGFR4 were shown to be expressed at a high level during early pancreatic development before embryonic day 16, their levels of expression decreasing thereafter. The functionality of FGFR was studied next. It was demonstrated in vitro that both FGF1 and FGF2 induce the expression of NGFI-A mRNA, a useful indicator of functional growth factor-signaling pathways. Finally, the effect of FGF2 on embryonic pancreatic epithelial cell proliferation was studied. It was shown that FGF2 induces the proliferation of pancreatic epithelial cells during embryonic life. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that FGFs are implicated in pancreatic development during embryonic life.

### 12073760
### Decentralization of the DOTS programme within a Russian penitentiary system. How to ensure the continuity of tuberculosis treatment in pre-trial detention centres.
### BACKGROUND: In Kemerovo region (Siberia), three pre-trial detention centres (SIZO; Ministry of Justice) serve as the gateway to the penitentiary system, comprised of 23 prisons and 30,000 detainees. The follow-up for tuberculosis (TB) patients released into civil society is unreliable. Due to varying detention times and frequent transfers to temporary detention centres (IVS; Ministry of Internal Affairs) for investigation and trial, and concerns about continuity of treatment, SIZOs were not included in the revised TB control programme initiated during 1996. METHODS: To investigate the feasibility of DOTS (Directly Observed Therapy, Short-Course) expansion into SIZOs, general detainee release was studied by examining 10% of files from detainees admitted during 1998 (SIZOs 1,2,3). Then, 5% of general files from SIZO 1 were examined to determine SIZO-IVS flow; 224 TB patient files from SIZO 3 were evaluated to determine the pattern of release/transfer. RESULTS: TB patients in SIZO 3 have less chance of release before six months of detention than non-TB detainees (14/224, 6.3% versus 774/2276, 34%; p < 0.001). Among detainees not released, 60% are not moved during the first six months of detention. For those who move, the mean stay in IVS was 9.5 (+/- 6) days. The incidence of active disease detected upon entry to SIZO 3 was 4,560/100,000, the subsequent rate during the same year of detention 880/100,000. CONCLUSION: Despite frequent detainee movements between institutions, DOTS should be introduced into the earliest stages of detention to prevent case mismanagement, and links to the civilian programme should be developed.

### L-dopa-resistant parkinsonism syndrome following cerebral radiation therapy for neoplasm.
### A bradykinetic form of parkinsonism, unresponsive to levo-dopa therapy developed in four patients two to eight weeks after completion of external beam irradiation (39.2 Gy to 59.4 Gy) of their intracranial neoplasm. In the absence of other causative factors, we relate the movement disorder to radiation-induced changes within the basal ganglia. At post-mortem examination one patient had putamenal gliosis and thickened vessels with loss of nigral neurons.

### 11809897
### Human AP-endonuclease 1 and hnRNP-L interact with a nCaRE-like repressor element in the AP-endonuclease 1 promoter.
### The major human AP-endonuclease 1 (APE1) is a multifunctional protein that plays a central role in the repair of damaged DNA by acting as a dual-function nuclease in the base excision repair pathway. This enzyme was also independently identified as a redox activator of AP-1 DNA-binding activity and has subsequently been shown to activate a variety of transcription factors via a redox mechanism. In a third distinct role, APE1 was identified as a component of a trans-acting complex that acts as a repressor by binding to the negative calcium responsive elements (nCaRE)-A and nCaRE-B, which were first discovered in the promoter of the human parathyroid gene and later in the APE1 promoter itself. Here we show that the nuclear protein complex which binds to the nCaRE-B2 of the hAPE1 gene contains APE1 itself and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP-L). The interaction between the APE1 and hnRNP-L proteins does not require the presence of nCaRE-B2. Our results support the possibility that the APE1 gene is down-regulated by its own product, which would be the first such example of the regulation of a DNA repair enzyme, and identify a novel function of hnRNP-L in transcriptional regulation.

### 9203528
### Regionally-selective down-regulation of NPY receptor subtypes in the obese Zucker rat. Relationship to the Y5 'feeding' receptor.
### Experiments were performed to examine whether there are regionally and subtype selective changes in the density of neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors in the obese Zucker rat which has an increased synthesis and release of NPY confined to the hypothalamus. Competition binding assays were employed to examine the feasibility of using [125I]peptide YY ([125I]PYY) to measure neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y5 'feeding' receptors in the hypothalamus, hippocampal and cerebral cortex following masking of Y1 and Y2 receptors. Y5 receptors could not be discriminated from the binding to Y1 and Y2 receptors in hypothalamic, hippocampal or cerebral cortex homogenates, possibly owing to the small population of Y5 receptors expressed in the brain and the lack of selective ligands for this receptor. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to examine for regional changes in NPY receptor subtypes in obese versus lean Zucker rats. The non-selective Y1, Y2, Y4 and Y5 receptor ligand [125I]PYY and the more selective Y1, Y4 and Y5 ligand [125I][Leu31,Pro34]PYY were employed, in conjunction with masking compounds in an attempt to measure any regional changes in the recently cloned NPY Y5 'feeding' receptor. Specific [125I]PYY and [125I][Leu31,Pro34]PYY binding was significantly reduced in the hypothalamic dorsomedial and arcuate nuclei as well as in the dorsal and lateral (perifomical) areas of obese Zucker rats, as compared to lean rats. In addition there were significant reductions in binding to the thalamic reuniens and centromedial nucleus, and hippocampal dentate gyrus of obese rats as compared to lean rats. Masking [125I]PYY binding to Y1 receptors using 1 microM BIBP3226 demonstrated that the reduced NPY receptor density was due to reductions in Y2 or Y5 receptor density. The binding which was sensitive to BIBP3226, i.e. Y1 receptor density, was not different between obese and lean rats. Attempts using [125I]PYY and the relatively selective Y2 agonist, [13-36]NPY to mask Y2 receptors and reveal Y5 receptors failed to leave any specific binding suggesting that [13-36]NPY was not selective enough to separate binding to Y2 and Y5 receptors. However, using [125I][Leu31,Pro34]PYY, masking binding to Y1 receptors using 1 microM BIBP3226 and masking any binding to Y4 using 1 nM rat pancreatic polypeptide left a small amount of binding remaining in the thalamus and hypothalamus, presumably to Y5 receptors which was significantly reduced in obese versus lean rat brain. These data suggest that there is a selective down-regulation in Y5 'feeding' receptors in the obese Zucker rat which is known to possess a hyperactive arcuate-paraventricular NPY system.

### 14585966
### Akt phosphorylation of serine 21 on Pak1 modulates Nck binding and cell migration.
### The p21-activated protein kinases (Paks) regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, transformation, and survival through multiple downstream signals. Paks are activated directly by the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 and several protein kinases including Akt and PDK-1. We found that Akt phosphorylated and modestly activated Pak1 in vitro. The major site phosphorylated by Akt on Pak1 mapped to serine 21, a site originally shown to be weakly autophosphorylated on Pak1 when Cdc42 or Rac activates it. A peptide derived from the region surrounding serine 21 was a substrate for Akt but not Pak1 in vitro, and Akt stimulated serine 21 phosphorylation on the full-length Pak1 much better than Rac did. The adaptor protein Nck binds Pak near serine 21, and its association is regulated by phosphorylation of this site. We found that either treatment of Pak1 in vitro with Akt or coexpression of constitutively active Akt with Pak1 reduced Nck binding to Pak1. In HeLa cells, green fluorescent protein-tagged Pak1 was concentrated at focal adhesions and was released when Akt was cotransfected. A peptide containing the Nck binding site of Pak1 fused to a portion of human immunodeficiency virus Tat to allow it to enter cells was used to test the functional importance of Nck/Pak binding in Akt-stimulated cell migration. This Tat-Nck peptide reduced Akt-stimulated cell migration. Together, these data suggest that Akt modulates the association of Pak with Nck to regulate cell migration.

### [Role of uric acid in cardiovascular diseases]
### Uric acid has been suggested as a risk factor in cardiovascular disease since the beginning of the twentieth century. While some clinical evidence have found a significant, specific and independent association between the uric acid serum level and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, others came to an opposite conclusion. Hyperuricemia commonly coexists with hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and others cardiovascular risk factors. This strong association makes the the role of risk factors difficult to separate out. Thus, the role of uric acid as an independent risk marker remains an open question.

### Innervation of the superficial pineal of the rat using retrograde tracing methods.
### Fast blue (FB), rhodamine microspheres (RH), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (WGA-HRP) were used as retrograde tracers to study the innervation of the rat superficial pineal gland (SP). One of the tracers was injected into the gland of each animal. All four retrograde tracers injected into the gland always labeled neurons in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG). No retrograde labeling was ever seen in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, habenular nuclei, amygdalar nuclei, or superior salivatory nuclei. Retrograde labeling was seen in the anterior hypothalamic nuclei, anterior thalamic nuclei, lateral geniculate bodies, and midbrain tectal structures when a tracer spread from the injection site to the overlying cortex, tectum, or commissures. Control studies included injection of tracer into the subarachnoid space around the SP or into structures adjacent to the SP. Only the injection of FB or WGA-HRP into the subarachnoid space labeled neurons in the SCG. This labeling was probably due to the spread of tracer to the choroid plexus. These results agree with recent work confirming the existence of a direct projection of the SCG into the interstitium around pinealocytes. The evidence does not substantiate an innervation originating in the habenular nuclei; the superior salivatory nuclei; or any other diencephalic, midbrain, pontine, or medullary structure.

### 14524797
### Direct observation of the effective bending moduli of a fluid membrane: free-energy cost due to the reference-plane deformations.
### Effective bending moduli of a fluid membrane are investigated by means of the transfer-matrix method developed in our preceding paper. This method allows us to survey various statistical measures for the partition sum. The role of the statistical measures is arousing much attention, since Pinnow and Helfrich claimed that under a suitable statistical measure, that is, the local mean curvature, the fluid membranes are stiffened, rather than softened, by thermal undulations. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to observe the effective bending moduli directly: We subjected a fluid membrane to a curved reference plane, and from the free-energy cost due to the reference-plane deformations, we read off the effective bending moduli. Accepting the mean-curvature measure, we found that the effective bending rigidity gains even in the case of very flexible membrane (small bare rigidity); it has been rather controversial that for such a nonperturbative regime, the analytical prediction does apply. We also incorporate the Gaussian-curvature modulus and calculated its effective rigidity. Thereby, we found that the effective Gaussian-curvature modulus stays almost scale invariant. All these features are contrasted with the results under the normal-displacement measure.

### 1944137
### [Experimental studies on argon laser angioplasty]
### To evaluate the safety and efficacy of recanalization of the occlusive arterial diseases by Argon laser, we investigated the effects of the laser irradiation using bare-ended probe (BEP) and metal-tip probe (MTP) on human cadaveric aorta and canine femoral arteries with thrombotic occlusion. In case of the BEP, the incidence of perforation of the arterial wall was high as compared with the MTP. However, laser angioplasty with angioscopic guidance could reduce the perforation rate, and made it possible to observe the new channel recanalized by laser. In case of the MTP, it was confirmed that the smaller MTP showed higher tip temperature and was more effective on plaques under the same laser energy. Optimal laser energy for single ablation was from 15J to 25J in case of 2.0mm tip and from 30J to 40J in case of 2.5mm tip. Application of the MTP equipped with thermal feedback control system could avoid the excessive thermal damage in comparison with the conventional MTP. It was considered that optimal temperature of the MTP equipped with thermal feedback control system ranged between 200 degrees C and 300 degrees C. It was concluded that laser angioplasty would be a useful treatment for the occlusive diseases of the peripheral arteries.

### 8789345
### Identification by NMR spectroscopy of oligosaccharides obtained by acidolysis of the capsular polysaccharides of a thermal biomass.
### This study deals with the chemical characterization of a capsular polysaccharide (CPS) produced by a thermal biomass largely comprising the cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus. The sugar moiety of this polymer is composed of seven neutral monosaccharides (Rha, Fuc, Ara, Xyl, Man, Glc, Gal) and two uronic acids (GalA, GlcA). Proteins represent 18% of the dry weight of the CPS. Organic acid substituents (acetate, pyruvate, succinate) were also detected and estimated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The presence of sulfate groups (5% w/w) was observed, which represents a relatively rare feature for cyanobacteria. Acidic hydrolysis of the purified polysaccharide led to the isolation of four oligosaccharidic fractions. NMR spectroscopy studies of two of the four purified oligosaccharides allowed them to be identified as: alpha-GlcA-(1-->2)-alpha-GalA-(1-->2)-Man and alpha-GlcA-(1-->2)-alpha-GalA-(1-->2)-beta-Man-(1-->4)-beta-Gal-(1 -->2)-Rha.

### 10407196
### Age-related relationship between mRNA expression of GABA(B) receptors and calcium channel beta4 subunits in cacnb4lh mice.
### In previous studies we found increased GABA(B) receptor number in 8-week-old homozygous Cacnb4lh mice compared to nonepileptic (+/+) littermates. In this study, we examined the relationship between Cacnb4 and GABA(B) receptor mRNA expression in brains from Cacnb4lh homozygotes and (+/+) controls. We found a significant correlation between the magnitude of increased GABA(B) receptor and decreased Cacnb4 mRNA expression in 8-week-old mice. In contract, in 6-month-old mice, there was no change in GABA(B) receptor or Cacnb4 mRNA expression. These findings suggest that the factor(s) responsible for decreased Cacnb4 and increased GABA(B) receptor mRNA expression abate in older mice.

### 705941
### Nitrogen elimination during steady-state hyperbaric exposures.
### Nitrogen elimination was measured in six divers during steady-state exposures in an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere at 1, 2, and 3 ATA using both oxy-helium and pure O2 as washout gases. This was accomplished by using mass spectrometry to measure the expired N2 concentration breath-by-breath over periods of 120 min in all experimental conditions except for O2 breathing at 3 ATA, which was limited to 30-min periods. In all cases the area under the elimination curve increased with pressure. Total area under the curve was also greater when breathing O2 than when breathing oxy-helium, but this difference decreased with depth and washout time. Nitrogen elimination on a semilogarithmic plot falls rapidly during the first four minutes and then shows a slow linear fall for the remainder of the measurement period. Effective elimination of nitrogen decreased with depth and oxygen was more effective than oxy-helium in washing out nitrogen at all depths studied. Possible causes of the different variations noted in the washout curves during the experiment are discussed.

### 14566763
### A randomized controlled trial of an educational intervention to improve phosphate levels in hemodialysis patients.
### OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a dietetic educational intervention on phosphate and calcium levels of hemodialysis patients. DESIGN: Parallel-group randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Teaching hospital hemodialysis unit in London, England. PATIENTS: Fifty-six stable adult hemodialysis patients with hyperphosphatemia. INTERVENTION: An educational intervention and one-to-one teaching session given by a renal dietitian, attempting to improve patients' knowledge of phosphate management and their compliance with diet and medication. OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Patients' serum phosphate, calcium, and calcium x phosphate products in the 3 months after the intervention, compared with those before the intervention. Results were also compared with a control group that had not undergone the intervention. RESULTS: In the intervention group, serum phosphate was significantly reduced after the education session, as compared with the results previously. In the control group, there was no significant change in serum phosphate level. The improved results were sustained over a period of 3 months. Serum calcium increased in the intervention group, but this result was not significant. There was an improvement in the calcium-phosphate product in the intervention group, but again this was not significant. CONCLUSION: Dietetic educational intervention can favorably alter patients' serum phosphate levels, with potential impact on morbidity and mortality.

### Are anesthetic accidents unavoidable?
### Fatal anesthetic accidents still occur frequently. Origins and causes are being reviewed especially in the light of lawsuits against anesthetists. The importance of utmost continuous supervision and care for both the vital functions: respiration and circulation, is stressed. General recommendations for security during anesthesia are advanced.

### 976316
### Analysis of cardiac chronotropic responses to some autonomic blocking agents in conscious trained dogs.
### The changes of heart rate in response to i.v. administration of methylatropine (0.5 mg/kg) and/or propranolol (2 mg/Kg) or practolol (2.5 mg/Kg) were studied in conscious trained dogs. Cholinergic blockade alone or combined blockade of sympathetic and parasympathetic effector systems resulted in cardiac acceleration. Conversely, beta-adrenoceptor antagonism with either propranolol or practolol reduced heart rate. The data were analysed by means of a new method, whereby the heart (HRN) of the dog is considered to be the product of the intrinsic heart rate (HR0) and 3 further factors: HRN-HR0 times S times V times W (Multiplicative model). 2 of these factors represent the tonic sympathetic (S) and parasympathetic (V) influences, whereas the third (W) represents the sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction. This type of analysis reveals that W was approximately 1, i.e., the sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction did not play any significant role in determining the heart rate of conscious resting dogs (HRN = HRO-S-V-W = HRO-S-V). The change of heart rate due to the action of parasympathetic system (-53% of the intrinsic heart rate) was more important than the change caused by the action of the sympathetic system (26% of the intrinsic heart rate).

### 15550924
### Efficient engraftment of in utero transplanted mice with retrovirally transduced hematopoietic stem cells.
### Using an experimental mouse model, we have investigated the kinetics of hematopoietic reconstitution of recipients transplanted during fetal development with fresh and transduced hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Total bone marrow (BM) and purified Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells, either fresh or transduced ex vivo with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-encoding retroviral vectors, were in utero transplanted (IUT) into fetal mice. Data obtained 2 months after transplantation showed a similar proportion of engrafted animals, regardless of the fact that samples were purified or not on HSCs, and subjected or not to ex vivo transduction with retroviral vectors. The transplantation of grafts enriched in HSCs, either fresh or transduced, always improved the levels of donor chimerism of IUT mice in comparison with results obtained in mice transplanted with unpurified BM grafts (6.8 and 7.3% versus 1.15% median values, respectively). Significantly, engrafted recipients that were transplanted with the transduced graft always contained transduced EGFP(+) cells in peripheral blood (around 5% of donor cells were EGFP(+) at 2 months post-transplantation). This proportion was essentially maintained at longer times post-transplantation, as well as in secondary recipients transplanted with the BM of IUT mice. Our study describes for the first time a significant and stable engraftment of unconditioned mice subjected to IUT with HSCs transduced with retroviral vectors.

### Antiseptic susceptibility and distribution of antiseptic-resistance genes in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
### We examined the antiseptic susceptibilities and distribution of antiseptic-resistance genes qacA and smr in 98 isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus obtained in 1992. Seventy-one strains were resistant to antiseptics. The qacA and smr genes were detected in 10 and 20 strains, respectively. The remaining 41 strains without qacA and smr were divided into two groups that exhibited low-level (n = 22) and high-level (n = 19) resistance to acriflavin. DNA cloning and sequencing suggested that norfloxacin-resistance gene norA was responsible for the high-level resistance to acriflavin. Our results indicated that four or more antiseptic-resistance genes exist in methicillin-resistant S. aureus and that antiseptic-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains without qacA and smr are widely spread in Japan.

### Beta 2 integrins are involved in cytokine responses to whole Gram-positive bacteria.
### Proinflammatory cytokines have an important pathophysiologic role in septic shock. CD14 is involved in cytokine responses to a number of purified bacterial products, including LPS. However, little is known of monocyte receptors involved in cytokine responses to whole bacteria. To identify these receptors, human monocytes were pretreated with different mAbs and TNF-alpha was measured in culture supernatants after stimulation with whole heat-killed bacteria. Human serum and anti-CD14 Abs significantly increased and decreased, respectively, TNF-alpha responses to the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. However, neither treatment influenced responses to any of the Gram-positive bacteria tested, including group A and B streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Complement receptor type III (CR3 or CD18/CD11b) Abs prevented TNF-alpha release induced by heat-killed group A or B streptococci. In contrast, the same Abs had no effects when monocytes were stimulated with L. monocytogenes or S. aureus. Using either of the latter bacteria, significant inhibition of TNF-alpha release was produced by Abs to CD11c, one of the subunits of CR4. To confirm these blocking Ab data, IL-6 release was measured in CR3-, CR4-, or CD14-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells after bacterial stimulation. Accordingly, streptococci triggered moderate IL-6 production (p < 0.05) in CR3 but not CD14 or CR4 transfectants. In contrast, L. monocytogenes and S. aureus induced IL-6 release in CR4 but not CR3 or CD14 transfectants. Collectively our data indicate that beta 2 integrins, such as CR3 and CR4, may be involved in cytokine responses to Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, CD14 may play a more important role in responses to whole Gram-negative bacteria relative to Gram-positive ones.

### 8908251
### Uptake of tetracycline in otoconia of the guinea pig.
### Calcium ion turnover in the otoconia of adult guinea pigs was investigated by observing the uptake of tetracycline. Oral administration of tetracycline resulted in the deposition of tetracycline (fluorescence) on the outer surface of otoconia, indicating the occurrence of dynamic exchange and/or uptake of calcium ions in the otoconia. Prolonged administration of tetracycline induced with fluorescence deposition in the central portion as well as on the surface of the otoconia. These findings suggest the occurrence of neogenesis, regeneration and/or growth of otoconia even in adult animals.

### 1645741
### Correlation of the inability to sustain growth in defined serum-free medium with the suppression of tumorigenicity in Wilms' nephroblastoma.
### We report the investigation of the growth properties of tumorigenic and reverted nontumorigenic Wilms' nephroblastoma cells when cultured in serum-free medium. Wilms' tumor, a pediatric nephroblastoma, has been associated with deletions encompassing the p13 band of chromosome 11 and an independent loss of heterozygosity at 11p15. Weissman et al. (Science 236:175-180, 1987) transferred a human der(11) chromosome into the G401.6TG.6 Wilms' tumor cell line via the microcell-mediated chromosome transfer technique. The resulting microcell hybrids were nontumorigenic when assayed in nude mice; however these cells retained all of the in vitro growth and morphological characteristics of the tumorigenic parental cells in 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Segregation of the der(11) chromosome from the nontumorigenic microcell hybrid cells resulted in the reappearance of the tumorigenic phenotype in vivo. In vitro culture of these cell lines in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10 ng/ml Na2O3Se resulted in sustained growth of both the tumorigenic parent and the tumorigenic segregant while the nontumorigenic microcell hybrids were unable to divide. The separate addition of either 10 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or 5 micrograms/ml of insulin did not alter this effect. However, the addition of 5 micrograms/ml of transferrin stimulated the nontumorigenic microcell hybrid cells to grow at a rate comparable to the tumorigenic cells. In addition, conditioned serum-free medium from the tumorigenic parental or tumorigenic segregant cell lines was able to stimulate the growth of the nontumorigenic microcell hybrid cells, whereas the reciprocal experiment had no effect on the growth of the tumorigenic cells. These data suggest that the inability of the microcell hybrid cells to grow in serum-free conditions is correlated with their genetic nontumorigenic phenotype and that a specific growth factor, transferrin, can bypass or alter this negative growth regulatory pathway(s) in vitro.

### 10337191
### [Skin carcinogenesis]
### Two main distinct subtypes of epithelial skin cancers can be distinguished, both arising from keratinocytes, most frequently at sun-exposed body sites. Basal cell carcinomas (BCC) grow slowly, nearly never metastases, whereas squamous carcinomas (SCC) are locally more invasive tumors, which have a greater metastatic potential. Skin carcinogenesis is a multiple step process, in which UV light play a major role. Numerous genetic lesions occur, either inactivating tumor suppressor genes (which normally repress cell growth), or activating oncogenes (which promote cellular multiplication). The most important tumor suppressor gene involved in both skin neoplasms is p53, which is inactivated in 40-50% of cases, by specific UV induced mutations. Yet, some differences exist between these two subtypes, which could explain their difference in invasiveness.

### 11673031
### Role of sultamicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam in the treatment of upper and lower bacterial respiratory tract infections.
### The emergence of beta-lactamase-mediated resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics among key respiratory tract pathogens has threatened the usefulness of the beta-lactam agents familiar to physicians as being clinically effective and well tolerated. This article reassesses the clinical usefulness of ampicillin when administered in combination with the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam, either intravenously or orally (as the mutual prodrug sultamicillin), in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Numerous clinical studies and several meta-analyses indicate that ampicillin/sulbactam and sultamicillin are clinically effective and well tolerated in both adults and children, in agreement with published North American and European guidelines.

### 3029428
### trans-activation of cellular and viral promoters by a transforming nonkaryophilic simian virus 40 large T antigen.
### We used the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) transient expression system to study the transactivating ability of a simian virus 40 (SV40) mutant that was unable to transport and localize large T antigen into the nucleus and which retained the competence to transform established cell lines. The effect of the SV40 wild type and the SV40 mutant for the large T antigen was tested in both mouse and simian cells on a series of plasmids in which the CAT gene was regulated by one of the following promoters: SV40 early and late, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase, chicken alpha 2(I) collagen, mouse H-2Kk. Our results indicated that both the SV40 wild type and the cytoplasmic mutant for the large T antigen regulated transcription from any promoter tested, suggesting that the trans-activation by SV40 does not require the nuclear localization of the 100,000-molecular-weight large T-antigen protein.

### 17286966
### Mechanism of dopamine mediated inhibition of neuropeptide Y release from pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells).
### In rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells the dopamine D(2) receptor agonists apomorphine (APO) and n-propylnorapomorphine (NPA) produced a concentration dependent inhibition of K(+)-evoked neuropeptide Y release (NPY-ir). The effect of APO was blocked by the dopamine D(2)-receptor antagonist, eticlopride, but not the D(1)/D(3) or the D(4)/D(2) antagonists, SCH23390 or clozapine, respectively. The D(1)/D(5) receptor agonist, SKF38393 or the D(3) agonists PD128907 and 7-OH DPAT had no effect. Selective N and L-type voltage gated Ca(2+) channel blockers, omega-conotoxin GVIa (Ctx-GVIa) and nifedipine, respectively, produced a concentration dependent inhibition of NPY-ir release but were not additive with APO. The Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) II inhibitor KN-62 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of NPY-ir release but the combination of KN-62 and APO produced no further inhibition. PMA-mediated protein kinase C stimulation significantly increased both basal and K(+)-evoked release of NPY-ir, and in the presence of PMA APO had no inhibitory effect. The PKC antagonist, chelerythrine, inhibited K(+)-evoked NPY-ir release but was not additive with APO. Neither forskolin-mediated adenylate cyclase activation and the active cAMP analog Sp-cAMPS, nor the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536, and the competitive inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinases Rp-cAMPS, had any significant effect on K(+)-evoked NPY-ir release. This suggests the inhibitory effect of APO on K(+)-evoked release of NPY-ir from PC12 cells is most likely mediated through activation of dopamine D(2) receptors leading to direct inhibition of N and L-type voltage gated Ca(2+) channels, or indirect inhibition of PKC, both of which would reduce [Ca(2+)](i) and inactivate CaM kinase.

### Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in an Australian aboriginal kindred.
### Four Australian aboriginal children were found to have nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. They are the sons of 3 sisters who were shown to have a urinary concentrating defect uncorrected by vasopressin. An extensive genealogy did not reveal any caucasian genetic influence suggesting that a new genetic mutation was responsible.

### 16725211
### Butyrate differentially regulates cytokines and proliferation in porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
### Although butyrate modulates proliferation and cytokine production by PBMC in some species, the role of butyrate as a regulator of immunocyte function in the pig has not been studied. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to determine whether butyrate influences peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation, cytokine secretion and mRNA expression in the pig in vitro. We also sought to determine whether alterations in cytokine production attributable to butyrate were associated with changes in the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3). Porcine PBMC were isolated from venous blood and stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate at 0.2 or 2.0 mM. Butyrate at 2.0 mM suppressed (P<0.05) ConA-induced PBMC proliferation and led to a paradoxical increase (P<0.05) in IL-2 mRNA expression. The secretion and mRNA expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by ConA-activated PBMC was increased (P<0.05) by butyrate at 2.0 mM. Exposing activated PBMC to butyrate at 2.0 mM decreased (P<0.05) the secretion of interleukin-10 (IL-10). In contrast, butyrate at 0.2 mM increased (P<0.05) both IL-10 secretion and mRNA expression. Activation of porcine PBMC with ConA increased (P<0.05) the expression of SOCS3 mRNA, and butyrate treatment further augmented (P<0.05) SOCS3 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, pretreatment with the adenyl cyclase inhibitor 2,5-dideoxyadenosine abolished (P<0.05) the inhibitory effect of 2.0 mM butyrate on IL-10 secretion, and partially reversed (P<0.05) the increase in IFN-gamma secretion induced by 2.0mM butyrate. These data indicate that the effect of butyrate on cytokine production by porcine PBMC is dose-dependent, and that butyrate increases the expression of SOCS3 in activated PBMC. In addition, we provide evidence that the effects of butyrate on IFN-gamma and IL-10 production are mediated in part via a cAMP-dependent mechanism.

### [Predictive factors of resistance to treatment of neuropathic pain]
### The aim of this retrospective study was to examine factors related to symptomatic pain treatment in 992 hospitalized patients referred to the pain clinic. These patients accounted for 1440 different pains (1.5 pains/patient), of nociceptive (59%), or neuropathic (24%) origin, a combination of both (16%) and of unidentified (1%) origin. Patients resistant to therapy did not differ from nonresistant patients (62%) in terms of age, sex, or number of pains. Although recommended pharmacological treatments were pursued, the neuropathic origin of pain was a factor in resistance to treatment. Among the neuropathic pains resistant to treatment (42%) a central nervous origin is more frequently found. Resistance to pain was more frequently encountered after strokes, primitive tumor of the central nervous system or traumatic plexopathy, whereas peripheral lesions of the nervous system were more easily controlled by symptomatic treatment. This study shows that central neuropathic pain is more frequently associated with resistance to recommended pharmacological symptomatic treatments. This observation underlines the limits of conventional medical therapy.

### 2957442
### Requirement for BSF-1 in the induction of antigen-specific B cell proliferation by a thymus-dependent antigen and carrier-reactive T cell line.
### We report here a role of B cell stimulatory factor 1 (BSF-1) in the induction of antigen-specific proliferation of affinity-purified small B lymphocytes by a thymus-dependent antigen and a carrier-reactive T cell line. By using an ovalbumin-reactive T cell line (designated Hen-1), which does not produce BSF-1 following activation, it was possible to demonstrate that the antigen-specific proliferative response of trinitrophenyl (TNP)-binding B cells to TNP-ovalbumin required exogenous BSF-1 in addition to direct interaction with irradiated Hen-1 T cells. The activation obtained under these conditions was highly efficient, being sensitive to antigen doses as low as 0.001 microgram/ml. The addition of saturating amounts of BSF-1 did not alter the antigen-specificity or the requirements for hapten-carrier linkage or major histocompatibility complex-restricted T-B interaction in this system. The involvement of BSF-1 was confirmed by the ability of 11B11 anti-BSF-1 antibody to specifically suppress the response of TNP-binding B cells to TNP-ovalbumin, BSF-1, and irradiated Hen-1 T cells. Finally, this response was augmented by addition of the monokine interleukin 1. These data indicate that the proliferative response of small B cells to the thymus-dependent antigen and carrier-reactive T cell line used in our experiments can be regulated by the same factors that govern B cell proliferation induced by thymus-independent type 2 antigens or anti-IgM antibodies.

### 7734845
### Mucin synthesis in immortalized canine tracheal epithelial cells.
### To study the regulation of mucin synthesis in canine tracheal epithelial cells, it is desirable to establish a cell line which synthesizes mucin continuously. We adopted the approach of immortalizing canine tracheal epithelial cells using a vector encoding the human papillomavirus (type 18) E6 and E7 genes. The E6 and E7 genes are essential and sufficient for the immortalization of human genital keratinocytes, as well as human tracheal epithelium. Primary epithelial cells from dog trachea were transfected with a vector containing HPV18 genes E6 and E7. The resultant cells (CT1) were cloned and maintained in selective medium supplemented with growth factors and hormones. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated the expression of the canine tracheal mucin (CTM) mRNA in these cells. The half-life of the CTM mRNA was found to be 45-60 min. Incorporation of labelled precursor (glucosamine) indicated that high-molecular-weight mucin glycoprotein was synthesized by these immortalized cells, which reacted with the antiserum to the native CTM. Equilibrium gradient centrifugation analysis showed that the buoyant density of the mucin synthesized in CT1 cells (1.486 g/ml) was similar to the reported value for native CTM (1.5 g/ml). Mucin which was isolated from immortalized cells was not a proteoglycan as chondroitinase treatment had no effect. These results suggest that CT1 cells synthesize a mucin glycoprotein which exhibits properties similar to native CTM. When characterized by immunostaining with a pool of monoclonal antibodies, these cells showed common epithelial antigens related to keratin expression. The CT1 cell line represents a unique resource for studying mucin biosynthesis and regulation.

### 10720779
### Transgenic mouse models in carcinogenesis research and testing.
### Double transgenic mice bearing fusion genes consisting of mouse albumin enhancer/promoter-mouse c-myc cDNA and mouse metallothionein 1 promoter-human TGF-alpha cDNA were generated to investigate the interaction of these genes in hepatic oncogenesis and to provide a general paradigm for characterizing both the interaction of nuclear oncogenes and growth factors in tumorigenesis. In addition, these mice provide an experimental model to test how environmental chemicals might interact with the c-myc and TGF-alpha transgenes during the neoplastic process. We show experimental evidence that co-expression of TGF-alpha and c-myc transgenes in mouse liver promotes overproduction of ROS and thus creates an oxidative stress environment. This phenomenon may account for the massive DNA damage and acceleration of hepatocarcinogenesis observed in the TGF-alpha/c-myc mouse model. Also, the role of mutagenesis in hepatocarcinogenesis induced by 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo(4,5-f)-quinoxaline (MeIQx) was demonstrated in C57BL/lacZ (Muta Mice) and double transgenic c-myc/lacZ mice that carry the lacZ mutation reporter gene. The MeLQx hepatocarcinogenicity was associated with an increase in in vivo mutagenicity as scored by mutations in the lacZ reporter gene. These results suggest that transgenic mouse models may provide important tools for testing both the carcinogenic potential of environmental chemicals and the interaction/cooperation of these compounds with specific genes during the neoplastic process.

### 11757242
### [Developments in chemotherapy; cytostatic agents with an increased specificity and other forms of administering cytotoxic antineoplastic agents]
### In recent years developments in molecular biology have greatly increased our knowledge about the cellular processes which govern the development of cancer. This has led to the development of anticancer agents that specifically target one of these cellular processes, for example, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and anti-angiogenic agents. In addition to this, new chemotherapeutic agents with increased target specificity have been developed. Finally, in recent years there has been an emphasis on developing new forms of administration so that optimal use can be made of existing chemotherapeutic agents.

### 20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of neonatal pig testis: 3 alpha/beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities catalyzed by highly purified enzyme.
### Pig testicular 20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20 beta-HSD) has also 3 alpha- and 3 beta-HSD (3 alpha/beta-HSD) activities. The purified 20 beta-HSD preparation from neonatal pig testes could catalyze the conversion of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5 alpha-DHT) in the presence of beta-NADPH to 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha,17 beta-diol and 5 alpha-androstane-3 beta,17 beta-diol at the ratio of 4:3, and the specific 3 alpha/beta-HSD activity of 20 beta-HSD for 5 alpha-DHT was about 10 or 15 times larger than the 20 beta-HSD activities for 17 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone) or progesterone, respectively. The result indicates that the testicular 20 beta-HSD has high 3 alpha(axial, 3R)- and 3 beta(equatorial, 3S)-HSD activity. The testicular 20 beta-HSD could catalyze the reversible conversion of various 5 alpha- or 5 beta-dihydrosteroids which have a 3-carbonyl or 3-hydroxyl group with beta-NADP(H) as the preferred cofactor. The enzyme transferred the 4-proS hydrogen of NADPH to the 5 alpha-DHT for both 3 alpha- and 3 beta-hydroxylation and it was the same as the 20 beta-hydroxylation of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. Although the 3 alpha/beta-HSD activity has been known to be present in 3 alpha,20 beta-HSD of Streptomyces hydrogenans, the enzymological properties for 3 alpha/beta-HSD activity catalyzed by testicular 20 beta-HSD were different from the properties for 3 alpha/beta-HSD activity catalyzed by prokaryotic 3 alpha, 20 beta-HSD with respect to the specificity of the catalytic reaction and the cofactor requirement.

### 8514418
### Osmolarity and growth phase overlap in regulation of Salmonella typhi adherence to and invasion of human intestinal cells.
### The study of the effects of osmolarity and growth phase on Salmonella typhi adherence to and invasion of Henle 407 epithelial cells provides the first evidence of a clear overlap between these two environmental stimuli. High-osmolarity conditions are required in the late-log phase for optimum induction of the adherent and invasive phenotypes.

### Schizophrenic disorder in old age. I. Some demographic, social and clinical characteristics.
### This study discussed 129 cases who were at the time of the investigation 65 years of age and older, and in whom during their life-time schizophrenic disorder was diagnosed. Using a modified P-86 questionnaire and SCAG scale, heteroanamnestic data and data available from the patients' medical histories, demographic, social, and clinical characteristics of this population were gathered. Among other things, the article shows that the present marital status is the result of psychiatric illness, that the trend of social upward mobility exists in this population as well, and that lesions of the sphere of interest are the result of the psychiatric disorder, while the lesions of the sphere of initiative are the consequences of ageing process. It is also found that in correlation with age the clinical picture of the schizophrenic disorder becomes less "clear", and that a trend of co-existence of affective disorders is present.

### Memory rehabilitation in Alzheimer's disease: a review of progress.
### BACKGROUND: Memory rehabilitation is a sadly misrepresented area of applied research in Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVES: To gather and evaluate recent evidence for the clinical effectiveness or ecologically validity of memory rehabilitation for mild to moderate Alzheimer's patients. METHODS: Computerised searches and some handsearching were conducted spanning the last five years, from 1995 to 2000, inclusively. Criteria for inclusion in this overview involved the use of a precise memory rehabilitation technique within an experimental study design applied to Alzheimer's patients with pre- and post-treatment evaluation. FINDINGS: Three potential levels of memory rehabilitation procedures with proven clinical or pragmatic efficacy were identified. The first level bears on the facilitation of residual explicit memory with structured support both at encoding and at subsequent recall; the second level of memory rehabilitation exploits the relatively intact implicit memory system (priming and procedural memory); the last deals with finding ways of coping with the patient's limited explicit memory capacities through the use of external memory aids. A proposal of suggestions for good practice and future research in memory rehabilitation is also offered with the hope to spur further development in this rapidly expanding area of applied research. CONCLUSION: The available evidence shows that alternative and innovative ways of memory rehabilitation for Alzheimer's patients can indeed be clinically effective or pragmatically useful with a great potential for use within the new culture of a more graded and proactive type of Alzheimer's disease care.

### Urinary response to an oxalic acid load is influenced by the timing of calcium loading in rats.
### PURPOSE: Dietary intake of calcium or dairy products has been shown to decrease urinary oxalate excretion by limiting its intestinal absorption. However, not enough attention has been given to whether there is any benefit from altering the schedule of ingesting calcium and oxalate. Therefore, we investigated the effects of changes in the timing of calcium and oxalate loading on urinary oxalate excretion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats weighing 180 to 200 gm were fasted and randomized into several groups. They were then administered normal saline or oxalic acid with or without calcium or milk. Calcium or milk was given immediately, or 5, 10, 15 or 30 minutes before or after the oxalate load. All treatments were given via gastrostomy. Urine samples were collected by bladder puncture just before administration and at hourly intervals up to 5 hours afterward. Urinary oxalate was measured by capillary electrophoresis. RESULTS: Urinary oxalate increased after the administration of oxalate alone, while it decreased when oxalate was combined with calcium or milk. Urinary oxalate showed a smaller increment when calcium or milk was given before than after oxalate loading, and it was much smaller when calcium or milk was given immediately before oxalate. CONCLUSIONS: Prior calcium loading appears to have a positive influence on decreasing oxalic acid absorption from the intestinal tract. Therefore, calcium or dairy products should always be ingested before a meal rich in oxalate to prevent oxalate absorption and decrease urinary oxalate excretion.

### Factor VIII related antigen in adenomatoid tumors: implications for histogenesis.
### The current study was undertaken to reevaluate the histogenesis of adenomatoid tumor by an immunoperoxidase method of detecting factor VIII related antigen, a tissue specific marker for vascular endothelium. Three of eight adenomatoid tumors showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining of the cells lining the lumina. When these results were correlated with the light and electron microscopy, it was found that there were two distinct groups of tumors. The vascular adenomatoid tumors stained positively for factor VIII related antigen and did not have tumor cells between tubules. The mesothelial adenomatoid tumor did not stain for factor VIII related antigen, had individual and solid nests of tumor cells between the tubules and had mesothelial characteristics on electron microscopy. These results strongly suggest that adenomatoid tumors can be subdivided into tumors of either mesothelial or vascular endothelial origin, and that these two groups can be distinguished on light microscopy.

### 1343466
### Limb lengthening operations.
### Limb lengthening operations were first used at the beginning of this century, they were, however, performed more frequently only in the fifties. The various, continuously elongating devices have made possible a substantially greater lengthening than earlier. Wide-range investigations were begun with the various distraction devices and the results were examined in regard to the site of lengthening, the injury of the periosteal and endosteal vascular supply during the operation and the extent and rate of the lengthening. Detailed results of 224 lengthening operations performed in 191 patients are presented in Tables 1 to 8. Attention is called to the fact that the operation should be performed strictly individually, and the patients should be well prepared to the operation and followed carefully. The number of complications increases in direct ratio with the measure of lengthening, the end result is, however, influenced only by a minor part of the complications.

### 16395756
### Streptococcal and enterococcal spondylodiscitis (vertebral osteomyelitis). High incidence of infective endocarditis in 50 cases.
### OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical, biological, and imaging features and outcomes of patients with streptococcal and enterococcal spondylodiscitis (SESD). METHODS: This retrospective study of patients with SESD was carried out in 2 departments of rheumatology from 1990 through 2002. Comparison was made with cases of staphylococcal spondylodiscitis (SSD) seen during the same period, excluding postoperative cases. RESULTS: Fifty cases of SESD were reviewed and compared with 86 cases of SSD. The main finding was a higher frequency of concomitant infective endocarditis in patients with SESD (11/42 vs 1/37; p = 0.009). Evidence of inflammation, imaging features, and neurological impairment at admission appeared to be less severe in SESD, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Duration of treatment was shorter in SESD than in SSD (105 +/- 26 days vs 130 +/- 49 days; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the high incidence of infective endocarditis (26%) during SESD. Clinicians must look for predisposing factors and clinical abnormalities in patients with spondylodiscitis whenever a streptococcal or enterococcal agent is identified. Echocardiography should be performed as routine in such situations.

### 2695276
### Metabolic considerations in the treatment of the black hypertensive.
### Hypertension and its cardiovascular consequences are both common and potentially devastating among black Americans. Recent evidence suggests that not all antihypertensive agents have similar efficacy in hypertensive patients, nor do all convey the same benefit in terms of reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. This review considers the efficacy of various antihypertensive agents in blacks, with particular reference to the impact of these agents on cardiovascular disease risk factors and on associated diseases often encountered in black hypertensives. Emphasis is placed on the use of therapeutic approaches other than diuretics alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents from the vantage point of efficacy and enhancement of cardiovascular and metabolic benefits.

### 3512708
### The major histocompatibility complex-restricted antigen receptor on T cells. IX. Role of accessory molecules in recognition of antigen plus isolated IA.
### Antibody inhibition studies were done to determine which molecules on the surface of the T cell hybridomas other than their receptors for antigen plus IAd were involved in interaction with antigen-presenting B cells, with artificial IAd membranes on glass beads, or with anti-receptor antibodies coupled to Sepharose beads. We found that T cell LFA-1 was only involved when B cells were used to present antigen plus IAd, whereas T cell L3T4 was involved in the response of T cells to antigen plus IAd either on cells or in artificial membranes, but not if anti-receptor antibodies were used to stimulate the T cells. From these results we concluded that LFA-1 may be involved in the recognition of a ligand on cells that was not present in artificial membranes, but that L3T4 might interact with a nonpolymorphic portion of class II molecules present in both intact antigen-presenting cells and the antigen-presenting artificial membranes.

### 10825018
### Mechanism of cross-ring cleavage reactions in dirhamnosyl lipids: effect of the alkali ion.
### Liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry and high-energy collision-induced dissociation were used to analyze a dirhamnosyl lipid mixture. The negative fast-atom bombardment spectrum reveals a mixture of four homologous dirhamnosyl lipids with the following general structure: Rha-Rha-Cn-Cm (where Cn and Cm denote 3-hydroxy fatty acid moieties). The mass region 450-600 u in the collision-induced dissociation spectra of the negative [M - H]- ions shows product ions that can be rationalized by terminal loss of a 3-hydroxyalkanoic acid residue; these ions can be used for the characterization of the fatty acid substituents. A unique effect of alkali-metal ions on the course of fragmentation of dirhamnosyl lipid attachment ions was observed. The strong chelation of sodium is revealed from the stability of the [M - H + 2Na]+ ion that does not lose a sodium ion with the eliminated neutrals, contrary to what is observed for the dilithium adduct. Cross-ring cleavages occur during high-energy collision-induced dissociation of both positively and negatively charged precursor ions. The results suggest a concerted decomposition pathway involving the six-membered rings of the monosaccharide residues. The formation of cross-ring cleavage products, which retain the C10-C10 moiety during high-energy collision-induced dissociation of all the precursor ions that contain sodium or lithium, strongly supports a retro [2 + 2 + 2] mechanism.

### 7206978
### [Surgical consequences of anomalous arterial blood supply and aneurysms in the epigastric region (authors' translation)]
### Abdominal angiography was performed in patients with occlusive disease of the iliofemoral arteries. In 85 of 389 patients, the anomalous arterial blood supply of the upper abdomen was detected accidentally: 81% of the variations were related to the hepatic artery, 19% to the celiac artery. The possible surgical consequences are discussed if these variations are disregarded. Four patients with aneurysms of the visceral arteries (three aneurysms of the hepatic artery, one aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery) and one patient with a celiac artery compression syndrome were also detected. The latter diseases represent clear indication for operation with high chances of success if treated in time.

### 9829253
### Systematic distortions in magnetic position digitizers.
### Medical devices equipped with position sensors enable applications like image guided surgical interventions, reconstruction of three-dimensional 3D ultrasound (US) images, and virtual or augmented reality systems. The acquisition of three-dimensional position data in real time is one of the key technologies in this field. The systematic distortions induced by various metals, surgical tools, and US scan probes in different commercial electromagnetic tracking systems were assessed in the presented work. A precise nonmetallic six degree-of-freedom measurement rack was built that allowed a quantitative comparison of different electromagnetic trackers. Also, their performance in the presence of large metallic structures was quantified in a phantom study on an acrylic skull model in an operating room (OR). The trackers used were alternating current (ac) and direct current (dc) based systems. The ac trackers were, on average, distorted by 0.7 mm and 0.5 degree by metallic objects positioned at a distance greater than 120 mm between the geometrical center of the sample and the sensor. In the OR environment, the ac system exhibits mean errors of 3.2 +/- 2.4 mm and 2.9 degrees +/- 1.9 degrees. The dc trackers are more sensitive to distortions caused by ferromagnetic materials (averaged value: 1.6 mm and 0.5 degree beyond a distance of 120 mm). The dc tracker shows no distortions from other conductive materials but was less accurate in the OR environment (typical error: 6.4 +/- 2.5 mm and 4.9 degrees +/- 2.0 degrees). At distances smaller than approximately 100 mm between sample and sensor error increases quickly. It is also apparent from our measurements that the influence of US scan probes is governed by their shielding material. The results show that surgical instruments not containing conductive material are to be preferred when using an ac tracker. Nonferromagnetic instruments should be used with dc trackers. Static distortions caused by the OR environment have to be compensated by precise calibration methods.

Six endurance trained men cycled on two separate occasions at a workload corresponding to 70% VO2max for 2 h followed by four "all-out" 30-s sprints. Following exercise, subjects were fed five high glycemic index (HGI) meals over a 24-h period, with the first three being fed either at 0-4 h (IT) or 2-6 h (DT) at 2-h intervals. Muscle biopsies were taken immediately after exercise and at 8 and 24 h post-exercise and analyzed for glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate. Blood samples were obtained prior to and at 30, 60, and 90 min after each meal and analyzed for glucose and insulin. No differences were observed in the incremental glucose and insulin areas after each meal when IT and DT were compared. In addition, no differences were observed in muscle glycogen or glucose-6-phosphate any time in the two trials. These data indicate that delayed feeding of a HGI meal by 2 h has no effect on the rate of muscle glycogen resynthesis at 8 and 24 h post-exercise, providing that sufficient carbohydrate is ingested during the recovery period.

### 2670301
### Fluoranthene-DNA adducts: identification and quantification by an HPLC-32P-postlabeling method.
### A 32P-postlabeling procedure for identifying and quantifying fluoranthene (FA)-DNA adducts has been developed through modifications of the method of Randerath and collaborators. In this modified procedure, labeled adducts are separated chromatographically by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. FA-modified DNA is digested to nucleotide 3'-monophosphates and nucleotide 3'-monophosphate adducts; unmodified nucleotides are then separated from adducts using a disposable C18 cartridge. Residual unmodified nucleotides, which reduce the efficiency of 32P-postlabeling of FA adducts, are removed by brief digestion with nuclease P1. This treatment selectively dephosphorylates unmodified nucleotide 3'-monophosphates, while FA adducts are minimally affected. FA adducts are then 5'-phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP. Prolonged treatment with nuclease P1 then is employed to remove the unlabeled 3'-phosphate from adducted diphosphate nucleotides, following which adducts are separated by HPLC and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Postlabeled microsomally-activated FA-modified DNA contained adducts derived from anti- and syn-2,3-dihydroxy-1,10b-epoxy-1,2,3-trihydrofluoranthene. The identity of the major adduct in DNA-bound microsomally-activated FA was confirmed by this HPLC-32P-postlabeling method as an anti-2,3-dihydroxy-1,10b-epoxy-fluoranthene nucleotide adduct. Each step in the procedure was optimized with respect to experimental conditions, and the recovery of adducts was determined by analysis of DNA modified with [3H]FA. In repeated analyses of 2-50 micrograms DNA containing 1.8 adducts per 10(8) nucleotides, 10-15% of total DNA-bound [3H]FA was recovered as the major adduct; recovery was greater from DNA containing higher levels of adducts. The reproducibility of multiple analyses of the same sample was approximately 5%, and multiple analyses at different times were reproducible within experimental error. The limit of detection of the method was approximately 0.1 fmol adduct, representing a binding level of approximately 3 adducts per 10(8) nucleotides in 1 microgram DNA or approximately 1 adduct per 10(10) nucleotides in 500 micrograms DNA. Because the method is not limited with respect to the amount of DNA that can be subjected to analysis, the inherent sensitivity for adduct detection can be greatly enhanced by analysis of larger quantities of DNA.

### 6819525
### Semipermeable membrane tubes: a prospective study.
### Four years ago, we introduced the use of Castelli membrane tubes into our practice. Although initial reports in the literature and restrictions on indications from the manufacturer on use were extremely cautionary, we were able, by careful intraoperative technique and the use of postoperative antibiotics, to expand the use of the membrane tube and offer it to our entire patient population. To document this, we used a prospective study of 124 consecutive ears receiving a membrane tube. Follow-up study included clinical, audiometric, and tympanometric evaluation. We found the membrane tube to function extremely well in an extremely high percentage of ears, regardless of whether the ear contains serous or mucoid fluid. The advantages of membrane tubes include the lack of special care required, resultant high patient and parental acceptance, and the low incidence of draining ears with tubes in place.

### 16270588
### Observation of 1,6-anhydro-beta-maltose and 1,6-anhydro-beta-D-glucopyranose complexed with rubidium by NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
### A complex of 1,6-anhydro-beta-maltose with rubidium and that of 1,6-anhydro-beta-D-glucopyranose with rubidium were characterized using 87Rb NMR spectroscopy, diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Although subtle differences were observed in the 1H chemical shifts of 1,6-anhydro-beta-maltose in between the presence and absence of rubidium in deuterium oxide, measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) of the 87Rb nucleus, the diffusion coefficients of 1,6-anhydro-beta-maltose using 1H DOSY and ESI-MS indicated the complex formation of 1,6-anhydro-beta-maltose with rubidium. The complex formation with rubidium was also identified for 1,6-anhydro-beta-D-glucopyranose using NMR and ESI-MS techniques.

### Oxidative enzyme activity in the rat soleus muscle and its motoneurons during postnatal maturation.
### The effect of postnatal maturation on changes in the oxidative enzyme (succinate dehydrogenase) activity in the rat soleus muscle and its motoneurons was examined at 3, 6, and 12 weeks of age. The motoneurons innervating the soleus muscle were identified using the fluorescent retrograde neuronal tracer Nuclear Yellow. An inverse relationship between soma size and oxidative enzyme activity of soleus motoneurons was observed at 3 and 6 weeks of age, whereas there was no correlation between them at 12 weeks. Although the oxidative enzyme activity in the soleus muscle increased during postnatal maturation, it showed a decrease in the soleus motoneurons. These data demonstrate that the inverse relationship between soma size and oxidative enzyme activity of rat soleus motoneurons can only be detected in the early postnatal period and that the oxidative enzyme activity in the rat soleus muscle and its motoneurons can change independently during postnatal maturation.

### 1422607
### The perception of emotion by schizophrenic patients.
### Studies which have examined the perception of emotion by schizophrenic patients have produced conflicting results, an outcome which may, in part, be due to difficulties in presenting a realistic portrayal of emotion. This study exposed 32 schizophrenic patients in remission and ten controls to five videotaped scenes of emotional situations played by actors. The schizophrenic patients were divided into three groups, namely those living with high-EE relatives, those living with low-EE relatives and those living alone, in order to test the hypothesis that patients in a high-EE environment are less able to identify emotionally charged situations. Measures of electrodermal activity and self-ratings of tension were recorded concomitantly. The schizophrenic patients in all groups were as adept at identifying emotions as were the controls. There was no difference between the groups in electrodermal activity and subjective tension for all video scenes, except for the one which portrayed the only pleasant interaction; the high-EE group was significantly more aroused on both measures, which were independent of each other.

### 14769434
### Deciphering the mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity in the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system--genomic and gene transfer strategies.
### The hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS) is the specialised brain neurosecretory apparatus responsible for the production of a peptide hormone, vasopressin, that maintains water balance by promoting water conservation at the level of the kidney. Dehydration evokes a massive increase in the regulated release of hormone from the HNS, and this is accompanied by a plethora of changes in morphology, electrical properties and biosynthetic and secretory activity, all of which are thought to facilitate hormone production and delivery, and hence the survival of the organism. We have adopted a functional genomic strategy to understand the activity dependent plasticity of the HNS in terms of the co-ordinated action of cellular and genetic networks. Firstly, using microarray gene-profiling technologies, we are elucidating which genes are expressed in the HNS, and how the pattern of expression changes following physiological challenge. The next step is to use transgenic rats to probe the functions of these genes in the context of the physiological integrity of the whole organism.

### Bilateral avulsion fractures of the cranial margin of the scapula.
### Avulsion of the cranial margin of the scapula is a rare injury. A case of bilateral avulsion fractures is reported. The postulated mechanism of injury is a powerful contraction of the omohyoid muscle avulsing its insertion. Conservative management was successful.

### [Comparing studies on the differences of CCl4 liver injury and immunity liver injury mice models]
### Comparison between CCl4 liver injury model and immunity liver injury model was studied through physiological, biochemical and gene expression profile methods, and the pathological mechanism of them were discussed. There are significant changes about the physiological, biochemical parameters including ALT,AST between two model groups and normal control group. Among the 14112 target genes, 379 and 293 differentially expressed genes were screened out from the both two model groups respectively in gene expression profile experiments, including 105 common, differentially expressed genes. The results indicate that the two models of CCl4 and immunity have some similarities. However, the differences between them are also obvious. It is useful for the further investigation on the liver-injury mechanism and pathological process of the two different liver-injury models.

### 9090806
### Drug use and lifestyle among college students in Austria and the United States.
### Using an anonymous questionnaire, we assessed the prevalence of alcohol use and illicit drug use among 545 college students in Innsbruck, Austria in 1995. The questionnaire also assessed various aspects of students' lifestyles, including academic performance, college activities, career plans, visits to a psychiatrist, and sexual activity. We compared these results with those obtained using the same questionnaire at a similar American college in 1989. We found that the prevalence of virtually all forms of illicit substance use was much higher among the American students. In both Austria and the United States, however, we found few differences between drug users and nonusers on most measures of lifestyle, with the exception of hetero-sexual activity.

### 9509736
### Gender and teachers' rating of linguistic skills among second-grade schoolchildren.
### The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible differences in linguistic skills and school achievement between girls and boys. In a nation-wide study, the achievement of 1,936 second-grade Finnish girls and boys was appraised according to the teachers' rating. The results were compared with the linguistic test performance of 364 pupils from the nearby area. The mean rates of girls in writing, reading, oral performance and attention were significantly higher than those of boys as evaluated by the teachers (p < 0.01). Also, the risk of boys to be below the median in their achievement rates compared with girls was higher (risk ratios 1.3-1.6, 95% confidence intervals 1.2-1.7, p < 0.01). In multiple regression analysis where birth order, duration of nursery day care, number of otitis media episodes and parental education were controlled for, male gender proved to be a risk factor for linguistic skills as graded by the teachers. Yet, performance in linguistic tests did not support the superiority of girls in linguistic skills. Professionals taking care of linguistic problems in children should be aware that teachers' evaluations are influenced by the gender of the pupil.

### 3973752
### Postadaptation orientation discrimination.
### An orientational difference of only 0.3-0.5 deg can be discriminated between two gratings or two lines, although psychophysical channels and cortical cells both have comparatively broad orientation bandwidths of 10-25 deg. One proposed explanation for the fineness of orientation discrimination is that, while detection is determined by the most excited orientation-tuned neural elements, superthreshold orientation discrimination is determined by difference signals between these elements [Westheimer et al., J. Opt. Soc. Am. 66, 332 (1976)]. This implies that, if stimulus orientation is changed slightly, the most important elements for discriminating this change will be those whose relative activity changes most, even though the excitation of these elements may be comparatively weak. In accord with this prediction, we found that adapting to a high-contrast grating degraded discrimination for test gratings inclined at about 10-20 deg to the adapting grating while having little effect on the detection of these inclined gratings. For test gratings parallel to the adapting grating, discrimination was improved, but detection was degraded. Either an opponent-process or a line-element model can account for these effects of adaptation. An opponent model can also explain our findings that subjects do not confound orientation change with contrast change and that suprathreshold orientation discrimination is almost independent of contrast, varying by only +/- 10% from about 3 to about 25 times contrast threshold. A discrimination model must incorporate reliable storage of spatial frequency, because discrimination was not affected by increasing the interval between grating presentations from 1 to 10 sec.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

### Genotype-phenotype correlations in hereditary familial retinoblastoma.
### We studied 50 unrelated pedigrees with a family history of retinoblastoma (Rb) (165 carriers of a RB1 mutation) to delineate the spectrum of RB1 germline mutations in familial Rb and to identify genotype-phenotype correlations as well as putative modifiers. Patients were followed at Institut Curie and they were examined by an ophthalmologist, a pediatrician, and a geneticist. All cases of familial Rb were determined via genetic counseling. Clinical features included disease status, laterality, age at diagnosis, mutation type, follow-up, and disease-eye ratio (DER). To eliminate mosaic cases, first-generation carriers displaying low-penetrance (LP) Rb were excluded from the analysis. Complete penetrance was the rule for nonsense and frameshift mutations (25 families) and high penetrance was observed for large rearrangements (eight families). Promoter (two families) and missense (two families) mutations displayed heterogeneous phenotypes and LP. Variable penetrance was observed for splice abnormalities (13 families) and was explained by in/out of frame mutations or respect of functional domains. Surprisingly, two families with the LP g.45867G>T/IVS6+1G>T mutation presented data that conflicted with the data reported in previous publications, as unaffected carriers had paternally inherited mutant alleles. Moreover, RNA analyses suggested that the lack of penetrance in unaffected carriers could be explained by an increase in expression levels of the wild-type allele. This observation prompted us to define a new class "3" of LP alleles. We believe this is the first large-scale study of familial Rb with a high level of homogeneity in the clinical and genetic analysis of patients and their relatives, thereby allowing for reliable intrafamilial genotype-phenotype correlations. Our analysis suggests in some cases the influence of modifier factors probably involved in mRNA level regulation and/or pRB pathway regulation.

### 7395831
### Acute glomerulonephritis and streptococcal skin lesions in Eskimo children.
### Poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis often follows impetigo and can occur in epidemics. From 1975 through 1977, an epidemic of poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis occurred in Alaska. Fifty children required hospitalization, while 25 less seriously ill children were treated as outpatients. Sixty-seven percent of these 75 children had direct evidence of recent skin infections. Serotypes 49-14 and NT-14 were the most common streptococcal isolates. In villages in the epidemic area, approximately 15% of children had impetigo and more than 60% of lesions cultured were positive for group A streptococci. Impetigo rates in the epidemic area were similar to those found in nonepidemic areas. However, the introduction of the nephritogenic streptococcal serotypes not recently present in this population apparently led to the development of the epidemic.

### 3930446
### Sulfate esters of hydroxymethyl-methyl-benz[a]anthracenes as active metabolites of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene.
### 7-Hydroxymethyl-12-methylbenz[a]anthracene (7-HMBA) and 12-hydroxymethyl-7-methylbenz[a]anthracene (12-HMBA), carcinogenic major metabolites of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) in untreated rat liver, showed high mutagenic activities toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 after preincubation with a sulfotransferase-PAPS system consisting of ATP, sodium sulfate, and a post-mitochondrial fraction (S-9) or a soluble supernatant fraction (S-105) from untreated rat liver. The 7- and 12-HMBAs themselves induced His+ mutation in TA 98 only slightly after preincubation with S-9 in the presence of an NADPH-generating system. Mutagenicity of DMBA toward TA 98 after preincubation with S-9 in the presence of the NADPH-generating system was remarkably enhanced by the addition of ATP and sodium sulfate. The active metabolites, 7-HMBA sulfate and 12-HMBA sulfate, were isolated from these preincubation systems and identified by comparison with the corresponding synthetic specimens. The sulfuric acid ester conjugates were potent mutagens toward TA 98 in the absence of rat liver subcellular fractions. The conjugates bound covalently at significant rates to calf-thymus DNA as well as to S-105 proteins at 37 degrees and pH 7.4 through the 7- or 12-methylene carbon with concomitant loss of their sulfate group. In the presence of S-105, glutathione inhibited the mutagenicity of the metabolically formed or exogenously added 7- and 12-HMBA sulfates. The non-mutagenic glutathione conjugates were isolated from the incubation mixtures and identified as S-(12-methylbenz[a]anthracen-7-yl)methylglutathione from 7-HMBA or its sulfate and S-(7-methylbenz[a]anthracen-12-yl)methylglutathione from 12-HMBA or its sulfate.

### 40341
### Changes in 2,3-DPG content and oxygen affinity in erythrocytes stored at 4 degrees C.
### The 2,3-DPG content of red blood cells increased within the first 24 h when fresh erythrocytes or whole blood were stored 4 degrees C. This phenomenon was strongly pH dependent. The temporary increase in 2,3-DPG was scarcely observed below pH 7.4 or above pH 7.8. In the case of whole blood, the increase was observed in CPD blood out not in ACD blood. Similar results were obtained with erythrocytes suspended in saline, when its pH was adjusted to approximately 7.6. Plasma proteins were not essential for the increase in 2,3-DPG content. Extracellular oxygen levels were continually measured in erythrocytes suspensions in order to check the changes in oxygen affinity of hemoglobin without damaging the cells. Both extracellular oxygen levels and 2,3-DPG contents were simultaneously increased by keeping fresh erythrocytes at 4 degrees C. Inhibition of glycolysis with sodium fluoride and monoidoacetic acid indicated that the in vivo steady state of glycosis in erythrocytes might be altered by chilling to make the rate of 2,3-DPG synthesis faster than that of 2,3-DPG decomposition.

### 12597586
### The relationship between amalgam restorations and mercury levels in male dentists and nondental health professionals.
### OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare the mercury levels in general dentists with the mercury levels in other health professionals using toenail clippings as a biomarker, (2) to identify risk factors associated with high mercury levels, and (3) to compare practice characteristics of dentists with high and low mercury levels. METHODS: A sample of 579 men was randomly selected from the 33,737 men participating in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study who had provided toenail samples in 1987. A questionnaire was sent to these male subjects in 1991 to obtain information on fish consumption, toothbrushing frequency, number of teeth, number of amalgam restorations, general practice or specialty status, number of amalgam restorations placed and removed per week, mercury storage and handling procedures, and mercury spillage incidents. A measure of long-term mercury exposure was obtained from toenail samples using neutron activation analysis for the 410 respondents (71% response rate). The 90th percentile mercury level in toenails (0.88 ppm) was selected as the threshold for elevated toenail mercury level. RESULTS: No relationship was found between the number of dental amalgams and toenail mercury levels among general dentists, dental specialists, and nondental health professionals. General dentists were found to have more than twice the level of mercury in toenails than nondental health professionals (mean level = 0.94 vs 0.45) and 60 percent higher than dental specialists (mean = 0.59). The combined use of disposable capsules and water storage of scrap amalgam appeared to reduce the risk of elevated mercury levels. Regardless of professional status, consumption of tuna and saltwater fish were the primary exposure factors that were positively associated with toenail mercury levels. CONCLUSIONS: As shown by the associations with dental profession and fish consumption, the mercury content of toenails is a stable biomarker of cumulative long-term mercury exposure. The lack of association between nail mercury levels and number of amalgam restorations suggests that avoidance of mercury amalgam restorative materials cannot be justified by the presence of mercury released from dental amalgams.

### 8712990
### Preclinical trial of a bioartificial liver support system in a porcine fulminant hepatic failure model.
### BACKGROUND: This study describes the pre-clinical trials of an extracorporeal bioartificial liver support system (BALSS). It includes the biochemical changes which occur in the plasma and blood of pigs with devascularized livers when the plasma is treated in a BALSS, and the testing of the system for presence or absence of infective agents, pyrogens and for toxicity. METHODS: Hepatic cells were prepared from littermate juvenile white landrace pigs with a double-step collagenase digest technique. The cell preparations were incubated with collagen-coated dextran microspheres (CDM) for 3 h and the medium was tested to determine cellular metabolic activity. Incubation continued for a further 20 h during which the hepatic cells attach to the CDM. The CDM-attached cells were inoculated into a hollow fibre bioreactor which was part of an extracorporeal liver support system. RESULTS: Hepatic cell content of the bioreactor was 6 x 10(9) +/- 3 x 10(8) cells, equivalent to those present in half a pig's liver. The system was tested in a controlled trial with the plasma of pigs with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) due to devascularized livers. When plasma from FHF pigs was circulated through the device there was significantly less of an increase in the accumulation of ammonia, lactate and most amino acids when hepatic cells were included in the circuit compared with those in control experiments when they were excluded. Similar changes occurred in procine blood. There were few infections diagnosed and an absence of pyrogens, endotoxins and toxicity in the bioreactor contents or in the terminating reservoir or animal blood samples. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the results, demonstrating function of the porcine hepatic cells in the circuit, together with low risks, justify a clinical trial of use of the BALSS in Australia.

### 10586228
### Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2.
### No unique genes have yet been found for CMT2, but both Cx32 and P0 appear to contribute to the phenotype. Not surprisingly, CMT2 is likely to display much more genetic heterogeneity than CMT1. However, it is also likely continue to challenge previous concepts on classification and relationship of traditional inherited phenotypes in neurology. Future work on CMT2 should produce insight not only into the cellular interactions of the peripheral nerve especially Schwann cell and axon relationships, but also into idiopathic neuropathy.

### 10804287
### Mutation of the SRC gene in endometrial carcinoma.
### Recently, an activating mutation of the SRC gene has been implicated in about one-tenth of advanced colon cancers. The SRC 531 mutation results in truncation of SRC directly C-terminal to the regulatory Tyr 530 and appears to activate the Tyr 530. To investigate whether mutation of SRC plays an important role in the development and progression of gynecological tumors, we performed mutational analysis of the entire coding region of SRC in 70 ovarian carcinomas, 68 endometrial carcinomas and 3 endometrial stromal sarcomas by means of polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) followed by nucleotide sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. We found one truncated mutation at codon 531 (Gln to Stop) in an endometrial carcinoma. However, we found no mutation of this gene in ovarian carcinoma or endometrial stromal sarcoma. Our results suggest that mutation of SRC may be implicated in a small proportion of endometrial carcinomas.

### 6165701
### In vitro contraction of the pupillary sphincter by substance P and its stable analogs.
### The effects of substance P and substance P analogs have been studied quantitatively by use of an isolated preparation of bovine pupillary sphincter muscle. Substance P contracts the pupillary sphincter in a dose-dependent manner with a value for median effective dose (ED50) of 1.0 X 10(-6) M. The effects of substance P result from its interaction with a specific receptor in the pupillary sphincter. These results strengthen the view that substance P is involved in the oculopupillary reflex.

### 17172290
### Saponin biosynthesis in Saponaria vaccaria. cDNAs encoding beta-amyrin synthase and a triterpene carboxylic acid glucosyltransferase.
### Saponaria vaccaria (Caryophyllaceae), a soapwort, known in western Canada as cowcockle, contains bioactive oleanane-type saponins similar to those found in soapbark tree (Quillaja saponaria; Rosaceae). To improve our understanding of the biosynthesis of these saponins, a combined polymerase chain reaction and expressed sequence tag approach was taken to identify the genes involved. A cDNA encoding a beta-amyrin synthase (SvBS) was isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and characterized by expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The SvBS gene is predominantly expressed in leaves. A S. vaccaria developing seed expressed sequence tag collection was developed and used for the isolation of a full-length cDNA bearing sequence similarity to ester-forming glycosyltransferases. The gene product of the cDNA, classified as UGT74M1, was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and identified as a triterpene carboxylic acid glucosyltransferase. UGT74M1 is expressed in roots and leaves and appears to be involved in monodesmoside biosynthesis in S. vaccaria.

### 8200509
### Val-237 for Ala substitution in the TEM-2 beta-lactamase dramatically alters the catalytic efficiencies towards carbenicillin and ticarcillin.
### The mutant 554 of TEM-2 beta-lactamase was selected for a decrease in the resistance to carbenicillin of an Escherichia coli K12 carrier. The amino acid sequence of the mutant beta-lactamase was determined by manual Edman degradation analysis of proteolytic peptides. A single substitution Val for Ala was localized at position 237. The mutant exhibited only 2% of the catalytic efficiency of the wild-type enzyme towards carbenicillin and ticarcillin, whereas it retained 30-60% of the hydrolytic activity towards other penicillin and cephalosporin substrates. Carfecillin, the phenyl ester of the side-chain carboxyl group of carbenicillin, was hydrolysed as a good substrate. This suggests that the behaviour of the mutant enzyme towards carbenicillin may result from ionic rather than steric constraints. A molecular model of the Val-237 TEM-2 mutant suggests possible electrostatic interaction between Glu-171 and the carboxylic group of the side chain of carbenicillin.

### 14585966
### Akt phosphorylation of serine 21 on Pak1 modulates Nck binding and cell migration.
### The p21-activated protein kinases (Paks) regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, transformation, and survival through multiple downstream signals. Paks are activated directly by the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 and several protein kinases including Akt and PDK-1. We found that Akt phosphorylated and modestly activated Pak1 in vitro. The major site phosphorylated by Akt on Pak1 mapped to serine 21, a site originally shown to be weakly autophosphorylated on Pak1 when Cdc42 or Rac activates it. A peptide derived from the region surrounding serine 21 was a substrate for Akt but not Pak1 in vitro, and Akt stimulated serine 21 phosphorylation on the full-length Pak1 much better than Rac did. The adaptor protein Nck binds Pak near serine 21, and its association is regulated by phosphorylation of this site. We found that either treatment of Pak1 in vitro with Akt or coexpression of constitutively active Akt with Pak1 reduced Nck binding to Pak1. In HeLa cells, green fluorescent protein-tagged Pak1 was concentrated at focal adhesions and was released when Akt was cotransfected. A peptide containing the Nck binding site of Pak1 fused to a portion of human immunodeficiency virus Tat to allow it to enter cells was used to test the functional importance of Nck/Pak binding in Akt-stimulated cell migration. This Tat-Nck peptide reduced Akt-stimulated cell migration. Together, these data suggest that Akt modulates the association of Pak with Nck to regulate cell migration.

### 18298
### Purification and properties of urinary alkaline ribonucleases from patients with nephrotic syndrome.
### Four urinary alkaline ribonucleases (RNase, EC 3.1.4.22) were purified from patients with nephrotic syndrome using phosphocellulose, DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-75 chromatographiy. These enzymes were designated as RNases 1--4, respectively, in order of elution on phosphocellulose chromatography. The respective purification of each fraction was 41-, 23-, 34- and 27-fold with a total recovery of 25%. The pH optima of these RNases were around 8.5 with Tris/HCl buffer and the reaction was activated by mono- and divalent cations, such as Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+, but inhibited by Fe2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+. EDTA had little effect on the velocity of reaction. The molecular weights of RNases 1--4 were estimated by gel filtration as 45 000, 32 000, 20 000, and 13 000, respectively. Each enzyme hydrolyzed pyrimidine nucleotides preferentially with higher affinity for poly(C) than poly (U) as determined with synthetic polymers and was free from other nucleolytic enzymes. The patients with renal disorders excreted one to four RNases in urine and the number of enzymes increased as the concentration of urinary protein increased. On the other hand, normal subjects excreted a single fraction essentially identical to RNase 1.

### 11289845
### Curing coupled-bunch instabilities with uneven fills.
### A new, unified theoretical description of coupled-bunch instabilities in unevenly filled storage rings is presented. Uneven-fill longitudinal dynamics are explained in terms of two physical phenomena: fill-induced tune-spread damping and modulation coupling of strong even-fill eigenmodes. The latter is also present in the transverse plane. The analysis yields simple criteria for optimizing fill shapes to reduce the growth rates of the most unstable modes. Experimental results from the ALS and PEP-II are shown to be in good agreement with the theory.

### 14764184
### Delayed presentation of totally avulsed right superior vena cava after extraction of permanent pacemaker lead.
### Pacemaker lead extraction has been shown to be an effective and safe treatment for infected permanent pacemaker leads, however, they may lead to potentially serious complications, usually occurring during the extraction procedure. This report describes a case of a 48-year-old woman with a patent persistent left SVC and an infected permanent pacemaker lead of a DDD pacing system who underwent transvenous laser-assisted lead extraction using a combined SVC and femoral approach. Two days after the procedure the patient developed symptoms of SVC obstruction requiring surgical intervention. The right SVC was found to be almost completely destroyed with only a thin strip of the lateral wall intact and active bleeding. The probable causative mechanisms and surgical management are discussed.

### ThePreschool Feelings Checklist: a brief and sensitive screening measure for depression in young children.
### OBJECTIVE: Childhood depression is widely underrecognized in primary health care settings. This phenomenon appears to increase with younger age. Evidence has been provided for a valid depressive syndrome among preschool children. Based on the need for the earliest possible identification of depression, the development of a brief screening measure to capture young children with markers of depression from these community settings was developed and tested. METHOD: A group of 174 preschool children underwent a comprehensive psychiatric assessment. The majority of this study group was ascertained from primary care settings using a 20-item checklist designed to capture depressive symptoms in young children. The assessment included the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version modified for young children and the Child Behavior Checklist. Ratings on the checklist were subsequently compared with these independent measures of psychopathology using several analytic strategies. RESULTS: The Preschool Feelings Checklist demonstrated high internal consistency, and 16 items showed strong associations with independent diagnostic measures of internalizing symptoms and major depressive disorder. The Preschool Feelings Checklist demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity for the identification of major depressive disorder at a cutoff score 3 or more. CONCLUSIONS: The Preschool Feelings Checklist is a brief and valid screening measure highly feasible for use in primary care settings. It demonstrated utility for the identification of preschoolers in need of formal mental health evaluation for depression.

### 14564464
### Sexual function and continence after ileo pouch anal anastomosis: a comparison between a meta-analysis and a questionnaire survey.
### BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ileo pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the standard restorative procedure for patients with ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis, but its pros and cons have not been explored in depth. This study analyzed the long-term complications such as incontinence and sexual dysfunction after IPAA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Netherlands Society for Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis) A questionnaire on complications, sexual dysfunction, and continence was sent to all 137 members of the Netherlands Society for Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis who had IPAA; the questionnaire was returned by 111. Results of the questionnaire were compared with those of a meta-analysis on pooled incidences of complications after IPAA, as previously performed and reported. RESULTS: Pelvic sepsis was reported by 15.3% of respondents. The reported incidence of sexual dysfunction (19.8%), passive incontinence (23.4%), and soiling (39.3%) was significantly higher than that in the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, 90% of the population was satisfied with the results of the IPAA. CONCLUSION: This study underlines that the operation itself, freeing patients of their disease, provides the major satisfaction and improvement of quality of life, even when patients have pouch-related complications such as sexual dysfunction and some degree of fecal incontinence.

### 6763470
### Skin-muscle flap lower lid blepharoplasty: an easier dissection.
### Most descriptions of the skin-muscle flap lower lid blepharoplasty, the so-called McIndoe technique, indicate dissection of the flap in a cephalad-to-caudad direction from near the ciliary margin toward the bony orbital rim. However, this report describes a technical variation in which counter-traction and lateral-to-medial blunt dissection "opens up" the potential anatomical space between the orbicularis oculi muscle and the tarsus and septum orbitale. This technique is easier and faster than the McIndoe procedure.

### Induction of O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase in the hepatocytes of rats following treatment with 2-acetylaminofluorene.
### Molecular and immunohistological techniques have been used to study the induction in rat liver of the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (ATase), following an acute dose (60 mg/kg) of the hepatocarcinogen, 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF). An increase in ATase activity was specific to the liver, with a five- to six-fold induction being observed 72 hr after administration of 2-AAF. A similar temporal increase of both activity and ATase protein (detected by immunoblotting) was observed up to 1 week following treatment, but after 2 weeks the activity had returned to control levels. Although maximal induction of hepatic ATase mRNA was observed as early as 24 hr, the levels remained elevated at least 1 week after 2-AAF treatment. Using a rabbit antiserum raised against purified recombinant rat ATase, ATase-specific staining was observed in the nuclei of both nonhepatocytes and hepatocytes in control liver sections. There was, however, a significant differential staining of hepatocytes across the liver lobule, with ATase staining being most intense in the periportal region. In the livers of 2-AAF-treated rats, an increased intensity of staining was observed in hepatocytes throughout the liver lobule, whereas the nonparenchymal cells showed much less, or no, increase in staining. The increased expression of ATase in hepatocytes and its differential distribution across the lobule were confirmed by image analysis. Thus, ATase induction in response to 2-AAF treatment was an hepatocyte-specific response and not confined to any particular region of the liver lobule.

### 1417851
### Tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 induce activin A gene expression in a human bone marrow stromal cell line.
### Activin A, a homodimer of the beta A chain, regulates hematopoiesis. In a human bone marrow-derived stromal cell line, KM-102, phorbol myristate acetate, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta induced great increases in beta A chain mRNA levels and production of activin A activities. The phorbol ester-induced beta A chain gene expression was inhibited by cycloheximide and down regulation of protein kinase C, whereas the cytokine-induced expression was little affected by these treatments. These results indicate that the inflammatory cytokines directly stimulate beta A chain gene expression via protein kinase C-independent pathways.

### 9238635
### Optimization and visualization of molecular diversity of combinatorial libraries.
### One of the major goals of rational design of combinatorial libraries is to design libraries with maximum diversity to enhance the potential of finding active compounds in the initial rounds of high-throughput screening programs. We present strategies to visualize and optimize the structural diversity of sets of molecules, which can be either potential substituents to be attached at specific positions of the library scaffold, or entire molecules corresponding to enumerated libraries. The selection of highly diverse subsets of molecules from the library is based on the stochastic optimization of 'Diversity' functions using a single-point-mutation Monte Carlo technique. The Diversity functions are defined in terms of the distances among molecules in multidimensional property space resulting from the calculation of 2D and 3D molecular descriptors. Several Diversity functions, including an implementation of D-Optimal design, are applied to select diverse subsets and the results are compared. The diversity of the selected subsets of molecules is visualized by embedding the intermolecular distances, defined by the molecules in multidimensional property space, into a three-dimensional space.

### 7866827
### Age- and sex-dependent force-related function of the cervical spine.
### A total of 272 normal persons (109 men, 163 women) between the age of 14 and 84 years was studied for age, body weight, height, neck circumference and neck length. For evaluation of performance, a lifting test and an isometric extension force test showed sex- and age-specific differences in this group. A reliability test with two independent observers showed a good correlation of two consecutive measurements. The lifting test (PILE) and the isometric neck extension force test (IMPET) have been shown to be easy to administer, inexpensive and reliable. The data presented can be used as a data base for European persons for clinical research.

### 8386187
### Role of phosphodiesterases in the regulation of endothelial permeability in vitro.
### Neutrophil-derived hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular injury and pulmonary edema. H2O2 time- and dose-dependently increased the hydraulic conductivity and decreased the selectivity of an endothelial cell monolayer derived from porcine pulmonary arteries. Effects of H2O2 on endothelial permeability were completely inhibited by adenylate cyclase activation with 10(-12) M cholera toxin or 0.1 microM forskolin. 10(-8) M Sp-cAMPS, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A agonist, was similarly effective. The phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors motapizone (10(-4) M), rolipram (10(-6) M), and zardaverine (10(-8) M), which specifically inhibit PDE-isoenzymes III, IV, and III/IV potently blocked H2O2-induced endothelial permeability when combined with 10(-6) M prostaglandin E1. Overall cellular cAMP content and inhibition of H2O2 effects on endothelial permeability were poorly correlated. H2O2 exposure resulted in a rapid and substantial decrease in endothelial cAMP content. The analysis of the PDE isoenzyme spectrum showed high activities of isoenzymes II, III, and IV in porcine pulmonary endothelial cells. The data suggest that adenylate cyclase activation/PDE inhibition is a powerful approach to block H2O2-induced increase in endothelial permeability. This concept appears especially valuable when endothelial PDE isoenzyme pattern and PDE inhibitor profile are matched optimally.

### 8327438
### [Immune reactivity and fibrinolysis in patients with disseminated pulmonary tuberculosis]
### Functional interrelations between immune and fibrinolytic systems were studied in 107 patients with disseminated tuberculosis patients. The findings showed a depression in plasminogen activator activity associated with high yield of fibrin degradation products. Lymphocyte blast transformation with PHA decreased, whereas that with PPD increased. Concentrations of IgA and IgG rose in a small drop of IgM in peripheral blood. The above changes were more pronounced in marked clinical symptoms. The results may give rise to further developments in pathogenetic mechanisms of pulmonary tuberculosis and new approaches to its treatment.

### 15588696
### Alternative splicing of mRNA of mouse interleukin-4 and interleukin-6.
### Interleukin-4 and interleukin-6 are multifunctional regulatory proteins, which participate both in haemopoiesis and in immunopoiesis. The alternative splicing of these interleukins in humans is known to proceed in a tissue-specific manner. Additionally, changes in splicing can also be dependent on tissue pathology. In this work, we report on the presence of alternatively spliced mRNA (IL-4delta2mRNA), lacking exon 2, in mouse bone marrow and spleen cells. We find that in unstimulated cells IL-4mRNA levels strongly dominate over IL-4delta2mRNA levels. Both increase in response to stimulation, with the concentration of the alternative variant rising earlier and faster than that of the full-length variant. In all other tissues studied dominance of IL-4delta2mRNA over the full-length variant was not observed. In addition, we find expression of three forms of IL-6 mRNA: the full-length IL-6 mRNA, IL-6Delta3 mRNA, and IL-6Delta5 mRNA in the second and third trimester placenta tissue and in the spleen of mice immunized with a high dose of sheep erythrocytes. It is anticipated that translation of these mRNA variants can generate proteins capable of binding to some subunits of the IL-6 receptor, thus possessing effector function. Alternative splicing is discussed as a source of cytokines with new regulatory properties.

### 1647093
### [Status of the thyroid gland in patients with schizophrenia]
### A study was made of pituitary-thyroid function in patients with different forms of schizophrenia. Radioimmunoassay was used. All the patients with schizophrenia showed impairment of interrelations within the pituitary-thyroid system, which manifested by accumulation in the peripheral blood of metabolically active T3 due to enhanced degradation of T4 in the peripheral tissues. The rise of TTH concentration represents one of the mechanisms of correction, aimed at the attainment of the physiological content of T4 at the expense of its additional output for its level in the blood serum is appreciably reduced.

### 12902869
### Why cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition plus chemotherapy?
### New approaches to treating cancers are needed. Preclinical studies have identified numerous candidate genes/proteins that promote the cancer process. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a reasonable "target" because it is found in many epithelial tumors, has been shown to portend a poor prognosis, and is involved in many processes that promote cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance. Inhibition of COX-2 also has the potential to provide supportive care to patients with cancer. This article describes the rationale for performing a phase II trial of specific COX-2 inhibition in combination with chemotherapy to define toxicity and efficacy. However, as with most new therapies, phase III trials will be needed to determine whether specific COX-2 therapy is able to improve patient outcome with a reasonable safety profile.

### 7514272
### Regulation of NMDA receptors by tyrosine kinases and phosphatases.
### Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are key enzymes in signal-transduction pathways for a wide range of cellular processes. PTKs and PTPs are highly expressed in the central nervous system, which is consistent with the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in neuronal function. Protein phosphorylation is known to be involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter receptors, but the effects of tyrosine phosphorylation on neurotransmitter receptor function in the central nervous system are unknown. Here we present evidence that in mammalian central neurons tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the function of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, a subtype of excitatory amino-acid receptor. NMDA-receptor-mediated whole-cell currents and intracellular Ca2+ responses are depressed by inhibition of PTKs. Conversely, NMDA currents are potentiated by intracellular application of the well characterized PTK pp60c-src. NMDA currents are also potentiated by intracellular administration of an inhibitor of PTPs. Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is a new mechanism for regulating NMDA receptors and may be important in neuronal development, plasticity and toxicity.

### 16460121
### Nanosized amorphous calcium carbonate stabilized by poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(acrylic acid) block copolymers.
### Particles of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), formed in situ from calcium chloride by the slow release of carbon dioxide by alkaline hydrolysis of dimethyl carbonate in water, are stabilized against coalescence in the presence of very small amounts of double hydrophilic block copolymers (DHBCs) composed of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) blocks. Under optimized conditions, spherical particles of ACC with diameters less than 100 nm and narrow size distribution are obtained at a concentration of only 3 ppm of PEO-b-PAA as additive. Equivalent triblock or star DHBCs are compared to diblock copolymers. The results are interpreted assuming an interaction of the PAA blocks with the surface of the liquid droplets of the concentrated CaCO3 phase, formed by phase separation from the initially homogeneous reaction mixture. The adsorption layer of the block copolymer protects the liquid precursor of ACC from coalescence and/or coagulation.

### Correlation between preoperative predictors and pathologic features in radical prostatectomy specimens in PSA-based screening.
### BACKGROUND: Measurement of percent free prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density, and PSA-transition zone density (PSA-TZ density) in addition to total PSA is known to improve the specificity of PSA-based prostate cancer screening. We evaluated the ability of total PSA, percent free PSA, PSA density, and PSA-TZ density to predict pathologic features in radical prostatectomy specimens. METHODS: The levels of total PSA, percent free PSA, PSA density, and PSA-TZ density assessed prior to the diagnosis of prostate cancer were correlated with the pathologic findings in 102 prostate glands with cancer obtained at radical prostatectomy. The entire organs were examined histologically; Pearson correlation coefficients were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: High levels of total PSA, PSA density, and PSA-TZ density correlated significantly with capsular penetration, high Gleason scores, and large cancer volumes in the prostatectomy specimens. Free PSA was found to correlate well with high Gleason scores, high percentages of cancer, and large cancer volumes, but not with capsular penetration. The four parameters were evaluated by means of logistic regression, which showed that only percent free PSA and total PSA were significant predictors of Gleason scores > or =7 and cancer volumes > or =0.5 cc. With regard to clinically insignificant cancers, only percent free PSA and the Gleason score obtained at biopsy were significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: In men whose prostate cancers are detected by PSA-based screening, high total PSA levels in combination with low percent free PSA levels are suggestive of a potentially more aggressive type of prostate cancer. This may help both patient and clinician in selecting the most appropriate therapeutic approach.

### 307451
### Immunological approaches to fertility regulation.
### Strong evidence that specific immunogenic components of the reproductive system exist that are not represented in other body systems has led to efforts to develop an acceptable vaccine for fertility regulation.  The aim is to create a vaccine administered infrequently by trained technicians outside the clinical environment.  For safety and practical reasons, an approach using active immunization with a vaccine is preferred to passive immunization with antibodies.  In current research with sperm antigens, a lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme (LDH-X), an enzyme normally present on the sperm surface, reduced fertility in mice and rabbits.  However, significant embryo mortality occurred.  Other sperm antigens have been tested and rejected.  Most of the research on ovum antigens is directed toward the zona pellucida, and work is in progress to isolate experimental quantities of specific zona pellucida antigens. Antibodies to human zona are reported to react with pig zona and vice versa, providing a model system.  Antibodies to whole-placenta homogenates reportedly disrupt pregnancy in several laboratory animal species, and 2 placenta-specific proteins are potential antigens since antibodies to them do not react with any other tissue so far tested.  Of 3 protein hormones isolated from placental tissue, 2 are potential antigens.  The possible hazards of antifertility vaccines can be divided into 2 categories: problems related to immunization and problems caused by antibodies produced.

### 10832890
### Capillary electrochromatography for pesticide analysis: effects of environmental matrices.
### An insecticide, pirimicarb, and a fungicide, azoxystrobin, were analyzed by capillary electrochromatography. Nine environmental matrices derived from soil, plant and animal extracts were used. After a series of 311 consecutive injections with no washing between injections, retention times increased by ca. 0.5 min. The use of exaggerated application rates for metabolism studies enabled the detection of xenobiotic pesticide degradates by UV absorbance. A 1.2 mm path length, high-sensitivity flow cell gave a gain in sensitivity; however, a further increase in sensitivity of at least two orders of magnitude is required for pesticide residue analysis. Analyte stacking using large volume injections of aqueous samples led to a large increase in retention times.

### 1993058
### Inhibition of methylcoenzyme M methylreductase by a uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine derivative.
### Uridine-5'-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine, when oxidized with periodate to the corresponding aldehyde (o-UDP-GlcNAc), was a potent inhibitor of the methylcoenzyme M methylreductase reaction which catalyzes the reductive demethylation of methylcoenzyme M to methane. The oxidation product, o-UDP-GlcNAc, appears to bind to the UDP-GlcNAc site of the enzyme and inhibits the reduction of methylcoenzyme M both by MRF or its active hydrolytic fragment HS-HTP. The kinetic patterns indicate that o-UDP-GlcNAc inhibition is noncompetitive with HS-HTP or MRF, and the Hill coefficient indicated that there was cooperativity between the UDP and HS-HTP binding sites. The methylreductase enzyme was protected from o-UDP-GlcNAc inhibition by prior exposure to low concentrations of MRF. HS-HTP, at the same concentration as MRF, was not effective in protecting the enzyme from inhibition by o-UDP-GlcNAc.

### Safety of plasma-based sterilization: surface modifications of polymeric medical devices induced by Sterrad and Plazlyte processes.
### Plasma-based sterilization is a promising alternative to the use of pure ethylene oxide (EO), for low-temperature clinical sterilization of medical instruments and devices. However, few studies have been published that evaluate its safety in terms of possible damage to materials, particularly polymers. The objective of this work was to evaluate polymer surface modifications induced by commercial plasma-based sterilizers, in comparison with pure EO: Samples from 5 polymer-based devices were subjected to 1, 5, and 10 sterilization cycles by Sterrad-100, Plazlyte, and pure EO. Surface analysis was carried out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), dynamic contact angle measurements (DCA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Surface oxidation and wettability changes were observed on all samples sterilized by plasma-based techniques, the degree of modifications depending on the sterilizer (Sterrad, Plazlyte) and the type of polymer. Drastic changes of surface appearance were also observed by SEM on PVC samples sterilized by Plazlyte and by pure EO. Possible repercussions on safety are discussed.

### 11118394
### Reactivation of hepatitis B virus replication accompanied by acute hepatitis in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy.
### We describe 2 patients who were initially positive for antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen and who experienced a strong and sudden increase of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We found that reactivation of HBV replication during HAART can occur independently of lamivudine resistance or withdrawal of lamivudine, and in spite of increasing CD4(+) cell counts.

### 16669580
### Early experiences with E-prescribing.
### Most physicians understand that e-prescribing will reduce medical errors and will be perceived by patients as making the prescription process easier. However, they are skeptical about a number of things. They worry whether their office processes will be improved or streamlined; e-prescribing will interface seamlessly with their existing practice management software; training and support will be available; e-prescribing data will be seamlessly transferable to an electronic health record when they implement a more advanced clinical record system for their practice; and if they will achieve a return on investment. Early adopting clinicians in Massachusetts can convince the majority of clinicians to adopt e-prescribing by sharing their motivations for adopting e-prescribing, the challenges that they needed to overcome, the hardware and software requirements, and integration into their office workflow. Finally, interaction with the physicians and practice managers in the audience makes the adoption of e-prescribing seem both reasonable and exciting. Resources such as vendor lists, questions to ask, and hardware and software requirements also need to be readily available and in a form that non-technical staff can read and understand. Physicians who know the "why" would also like to know

### Alterations of platelet function induced by interleukin-2.
### We recently reported that thrombocytopenia and bleeding are often limiting effects of immunotherapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2). In order to understand the mechanisms that lead to this unexpected clinical toxicity, we studied the effects of IL-2 on in vitro platelet function. When platelet aggregation was studied using whole blood (impedance, electrical) aggregometry, inhibition of aggregation was detected within 1 min of the addition of exogenous IL-2 to whole blood. IL-2-induced platelet secretion was quantified by radioimmunoassay (RIA) of PF4, BTG, and TXB2 independent of the addition of an aggregating agonist (ADP). Platelet secretion and inhibition of aggregation were an indirect consequence of a cellular effect of IL-2 on mononuclear cells, since aggregation was normal when whole blood was depleted of mononuclear cells and its reconstitution with autologous mononuclear cells led to a cell concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of aggregation and release of alpha-granule components in the presence of IL-2. In order to understand the mechanism of platelet secretion mediated by IL-2-activated mononuclear cells, we quantified the release of eicosanoid products from cultures of mononuclear cells exposed to IL-2 and found a significant increase in TXB2. Our results indicate that platelet secretion, indirectly initiated by IL-2-activated cells, is followed by inhibition of aggregation. These findings may not only have important implications for the planning of clinical immunotherapy trials with IL-2, but may also provide a novel link for a better understanding of the relationships between the hemostatic and the immune systems.

### Apoptosis detection: an overview.
### As the analysis of apoptosis is of interest in many basic and clinically oriented investigations, we intend to give a brief overview on the recently most-used methods for detection of apoptotic cells, including the study of morphology, analysis of DNA degradation, DNA end-labeling techniques, flow cytometric analysis, and nuclease assays. Features and advantages of the different methods are discussed.

### 17216981
### Influence of free radicals on cardiovascular risk due to occupational exposure to mercury.
### This study was designed to investigate the relation between occupational exposure to mercury and cardiovascular risk, as well as free radicals. The study subjects included 30 male workers exposed to mercury from a fluorescent lamp plant in Alexandria after exclusion of 12 workers with conditions that may bias the results. A matched control group of 20 male subjects were selected from a food industrial plant. The participants were subjected to interview, clinical examination, electrocardiography and R-R deep breathing variability test as a measure of cardiac autonomic function. Spot urine and venous blood samples were collected to measure mercury levels. Free radicals related markers were measured in serum namely lipid peroxide, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase activity and glutathione S-transferase. Results showed significant longer electrocardiographic Q-Tc interval, which is corrected to heart rate, in exposed workers than in controls (p=0.002). The R-R deep breathing variability indices were significantly increased among exposed workers in comparison to controls (maximal variation (MV) ratio, p=0.024 & MV rate, p=0.019). The mercury levels in both urine and blood of exposed workers were significantly higher than controls (p<0.0001), with mean levels exceeding the permissible limits. Free radicals related markers revealed significant higher level of lipid peroxide, as well as significant lower levels of SOD activity, catalase activity and glutathione S-transferase among exposed workers than among controls (p<0.0001 for all). Independent relations were observed between Q-Tc and lipid peroxide, and between MV rate and SOD and catalase activities among exposed workers after adjustment for the confounders by multivariate regression analyses. These findings may suspect a cardiac autonomic dysfunction probably related to free radicals in mercury exposed workers. Also, it may through light on some preventive implications.

### 493877
### Biochemical studies in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.
### In order to find the basic defect in the Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS), biochemical studies of platelets and leucocytes were undertaken. Glutathione levels of platelets were normal and regeneration of GSH similar to controls occurred after incubation with diamide (a specific agent for GSH oxidation). Phospholipid and fatty acid composition of HPS platelets was normal. The amount of peroxides found in platelet membranes was not elevated. A subnormal aggregation with arachidonic acid could be obtained in PRP using a high concentration of arachidonic acid (2 mM), but normal malondialdehyde levels were measured, suggesting a normal prostaglandin synthesis in HPS platelets. Glutathion peroxidase and p-phenylenediamide-mediated peroxidase (PPD-peroxidase) were normal in leucocytes of 1 HPS patient. Lysosomal enzymes as far as investigated were normal.

### 15654044
### Postinfectious vasculopathy with evolution to moyamoya syndrome.
### BACKGROUND: Parainfectious vascular events are a known complication of bacterial meningitis, typically occurring within two weeks of disease onset. Delayed vascular complications are rare. We present a case of progressive vasculopathy following bacterial meningitis. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 20 year old woman developed progressive vasculopathy after successful treatment of pneumococcal meningitis. Within eight months of her infection, angiography revealed the appearance of moyamoya syndrome. Despite aggressive immunomodulation and anticoagulation, she had multiple strokes. Autopsy confirmed severe narrowing of proximal cerebral vasculature with absence of inflammation or atherosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: The inflammation and subsequent postinfectious autoimmune response associated with meningitis can lead to a progressive vasculopathy and may represent a pathophysiologic mechanism for the arterial occlusions seen in moyamoya syndrome.

### 11082061
### Protection against cutaneous leishmaniasis resulting from bites of uninfected sand flies.
### Despite the fact that Leishmania are transmitted exclusively by sand flies, none of the experimental models of leishmaniasis have established infection via sand fly bites. Here we describe a reproducible murine model of Leishmania major infection transmitted by Phlebotomus papatasi. Prior exposure of mice to bites of uninfected sand flies conferred powerful protection against Leishmania major that was associated with a strong delayed-type hypersensitivity response and with interferon-gamma production at the site of parasite delivery. These results have important implications for the epidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis and suggest a vaccination strategy against this and possibly other vector-borne diseases.

### 17432172
### [Observation and description--neurology as a field work science]
### Scientific researches in medicine could be classified into two categories; an experimental medicine or a science for solving various problems and a field work medicine for discovering new problems. Although both fields of medical researches are requisite for the real progress of medicine, the importance of the latter field is now a little neglected. As the President of the 47th annual meeting of Japanese Society of Neurology, I chose "Quo vadis, Neurologia" quoting Sienkiewicz as a grand theme of the meeting and tried to find out answers to secure the future of clinical neurology. This presidential lecture is to stress the importance of a field work type of clinical researches in neurological sciences to which we, clinical neurologists, have the privileges of daily access.

### 2102833
### The isolation and sequence analysis of two seed-expressed acyl carrier protein genes from Brassica napus.
### Genomic Southern blot analysis of Brassica napus DNA indicates that seed-expressed acyl carrier protein (ACP) is encoded by a multigene family of some 35 genes/haploid genome. Two genomic clones encoding B. napus ACP have been isolated and sequenced. The coding sequences of the 2 respective genes were found to be perfectly homologous to 2 distinct B. napus seed-expressed cDNAs and therefore represent seed-expressed forms of ACP. The 2 genomic ACP sequences share 94% homology within their coding sequences. Both genes are interrupted by 3 intervening sequences whose position within the 2 coding sequences is conserved. RNase protection studies were used to map the transcription start site of one of the genes and to provide further evidence that the gene is seed-expressed. The expression of a sub-group of the ACP gene family was found to be developmentally regulated in concert with the storage lipid synthetic phase of seed development. The coding sequence of both B. napus genes are highly homologous (96% and 93% respectively) to a Brassica campestris ACP cDNA sequence, suggesting that they may have evolved from this ancestral gene.

### Enhancement of the rectal absorption of sodium ampicillin by N-acylamino acids in rats.
### The promoting efficacies of N-acyl derivatives of amino acids on the rectal absorption of sodium ampicillin were investigated using the rat rectal loop technique. N-Acyl derivatives with longer carbon chains in the acyl moiety showed a greater promoting potency. The promoting potencies of N-acyl derivatives of phenylglycine and phenylalanine were greater than those of glycine and alanine derivatives when compared at the same length of carbon chain in their acyl moieties. The promoting action of N-acylamino acids was not influenced by the presence of N-ethylmaleimide or ouabain. The promoting potencies of N-acylamino acids were depressed in the presence of calcium chloride in the rectal loop. The contribution of the calcium ion sequestration capacity of N-acylamino acids to their promoting efficacies is discussed.

### 16641891
### [Molecular basis of hereditary hemochromatosis]
### Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic metabolic disease characterized by increased intestinal iron absorption and progressive iron loading in the cells of various organs. Human body iron homeostasis involves a number of complicated processes, some of which are not identified yet. Genetic analysis of patients affected by HH recently led to the discovery of many novel proteins and mechanisms that can influence the uptake, transport, storage, and excretion of iron. It also showed that hemochromatosis is a very complex disease and that the type of mutation can influence its clinical manifestation. This review presents the current knowledge about the mechanisms of iron metabolism and describes the types of hereditary hemochromatosis and the mutations which induce the disease.

### 15512847
### Polyclonal antibody effects on the human cardiac 5-HT4(e) receptors depend upon the expression system.
### The initial objective of this work was to examine the effects of an antibody (Anti-G21V) directed against the second extracellular loop of human heart 5-HT4 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The antibody anti-G21V had no effect upon either basal cAMP-or 5-HT-evoked increases in cAMP in CHO cells, whereas it had shown an agonist-like effect in COS-7 cells. Analysis of agonist fractions of h5-HT4(e) receptors in CHO and COS-7 cells revealed that equilibrium constant could underlie the different responses of the receptor toward the anti-G21V antibody. Therefore, different expression systems could give rise to functional differences in 5-HT4 receptor behavior.

### 17646501
### A psychological basis for anesthesiologists' operating room managerial decision-making on the day of surgery.
### BACKGROUND: We investigated whether, without prompting, anesthesiologists tend to make managerial decisions to increase the clinical work per unit time of the sites to which they are assigned during their scheduled time present. Although a sound basis for decision-making involving individual ORs, the heuristic is often suboptimal economically when applied to decisions involving multiple ORs. METHODS: Two studies were performed at one hospital. 1) A retrospective analysis was made of anesthesiologists' managerial decisions when caring for sequential lists of patients. 2) Patients' and surgeons' waiting on nights and weekends were studied before/after education on optimal decision-making. RESULTS: 1) Anesthesiologists' decisions resulted in an increase in their clinical work per unit time, not a reduction in patient waiting. 2) Paradoxically, such efforts on nights and weekends caused increased patient and surgeon waiting. Decisions were unchanged after education on a different way to assign cases. CONCLUSIONS: In a companion article, we showed that clinicians tended to make decisions that increased the clinical work per unit time at each moment in each OR, even when doing so resulted in an increase in overutilized OR time, higher staffing costs, unpredictable work hours, and/or mandatory overtime. The current studies show that such efforts to work fast cannot be explained as a consequence of efforts to reduce surgeon and patient waiting. Rather, the heuristic followed is consistent with increasing one's personal clinical work per unit time at one's assigned anesthetizing location.

### 6763881
### Immune reactivity of spleen cells in advanced stages of tumor growth.
### In a syngeneic tumor model by an indirect migration inhibition technique, using spleen cells from mice bearing large tumors (ATB-SC) no detectable amounts of migration inhibition factor (MIF) was found in response to either tumor cells or tumor extract. Although lymphokine production was suppressed, ATB-SC were able to respond to exogenous MIF and also to transfer a positive delayed foot-pad reaction (DFR) when co-inoculated with both forms of antigen into normal mice. These observations showed that in advanced stages of tumor development, when the ability of spleen cells to produce MIF toward tumor cells or tumor extract is lost, neither their capability to transfer a positive DFR not their responsiveness to MIF-rich culture supernatants were impaired.

### 1567680
### Adequate tumour quinidine levels for multidrug resistance modulation can be achieved in vivo.
### The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype can be reversed in vitro by a number of agents thought to interact with P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Although plasma levels, adequate for MDR modulation, can be achieved with certain modulators, concern has been expressed that tumour levels may be inadequate due to high plasma protein binding. Mice bearing an MDR-positive human tumour xenograft were injected intraperitoneally with quinidine (150 mg/kg). After 2 h the mean plasma quinidine level was 1.9 micrograms/ml (5.1 mumol/l) and the mean tumour quinidine effective in vitro. Three tumour biopsy specimens were obtained from patients who had received oral quinidine prior to surgery. Plasma and tumour levels were similar and were comparable with those measured in mice. This study should dispel fears of inadequate tumour levels of this and other modulators due to high plasma protein binding and encourage future clinical trials of modulators in MDR-positive human tumours.

### 856837
### Studies on a fractionated murine fibrosarcoma: a reproducible method for the cautious and a caution for the unwary.
### A technique is described for the dissociation and fractionation by isopycnic centrifugation (4,000 x g, 60 minutes, 4 degrees C) in linear bovine albumin density gradients (12 ml, pH 5.2 real osmolality 333 mmol/Kg water, 1.030-1.075 g/cm3) of cells ( less than or equal to 3 x 10(7)/gradient) released by a strictly standardised combination of mechanical and enzymatic means from a transplantable methylcholanthrene induced BALB/c fibrosarcoma. Optimal conditions for reproducible localisation of cell bands with maintenance of both satisfactory resolution and satisfactory viable cell recovery ( greater than 80%) were established by means of a series of simultaneous double fractionation experiments. When rebanding was performed under these conditions the density of the median of the cell count of the refractioned cells shifted less than 0.0005 g/cm3. Experiments also showed that close adherence to certain aspects of the tissue dissociation and fractionation protocol was necessary to avoid reduced cell yields and viabilities, density-dependent selective cell lossses, reductions in resolution and shifts in the location of cell bands. Other aspects of the protocol were tolerant to variation without introducting artefacts.

### 7130479
### Afferent neurons in the hypoglossal nerve of the zebra finch (Poephila guttata): localization with horseradish peroxidase.
### Hypoglossal efferent fibers are known to innervate the vocal organ (syrinx) in songbirds. In order to determine the existence of afferent fibers from the syrinx in the zebra finch, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was applied to the cut peripheral branch of the hypoglossal nerve that innervates the left side of the syrinx. Cell bodies in the ganglion of the left vagus nerve were labeled, but no transganglionic (anterograde) transport into the CNS was observed at transport intervals of 1 to 5 days. (In comparison applying HRP to the cut descending branch of the vagus produced labeled cell bodies in the vagal ganglion as well as heavy anterograde label extending into the solitary nucleus.) Injection of HRP conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin into the intrinsic syringeal muscles also labeled cell bodies in the vagal ganglion, and again no transganglionic label was observed. Application of HRP more proximally to the cut hypoglossal truck resulted in the appearance of labeled cell bodies in the vagal ganglion as well as the anterograde label extending from the descending trigeminal tract to the principal sensory nucleus of V. These results indicate that hypoglossal afferents have cell bodies in the vagal ganglion, enter the medulla dorsally with vagal fibers, and terminate in the trigeminal complex. The identification of these afferent fibers raises the important question of their role in vocal learning.

### Endogenous microbial dissemination following severe burns in rats.
### This study suggests that damage to the intestinal lining, an important mechanical barrier against bacterial invasion, is the main factor leading to the dissemination of endogenous microbes. Reduced phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells and compromised opsonic function also appear to contribute to the process.

### 17393655
### In vitro cytotoxic activities of (+)-usnic acid and (-)-usnic acid on V79, A549, and human lymphocyte cells and their non-genotoxicity on human lymphocytes.
### This study investigates cytotoxic and genotoxic activities of (+)-Usnic acid and (-)-usnic acid isolated from the lichen Ramalina farinacea and the lichen Cladonia foliacea, respectively. To determine the activities of these acids, we used the MTT assay on V79 (Chinese hamster lung fibroblast like) and A549 (human lung carcinoma epithelial like) cell lines and cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) assay in human lymphocytes in vitro. Our results suggest that both enantiomers of usnic acid are non-genotoxic shown by the absence of micronucleus induction in human lymphocytes and have significant cytotoxic and apoptotic effects to induce cell killing in cultured human lymphocytes, V79 and A549 cell lines. Even low doses of (+)-usnic acid showed high cytotoxic activity against cancerous cells. The MTT results and cell proliferation index (CPI) values based on the CBMN test results are found in good agreement.

### 3820306
### A cell-cycle-dependent DNA polymerase activity that replicates intact DNA in chromatin.
### An insoluble DNA polymerase activity that replicates the intact chromatin template at 85% of the rate found in vivo has been partially characterized. HeLa cells, encapsulated in agarose microbeads, are lysed using an isotonic salt concentration: the resulting encapsulated nuclei contain polymerase associated with a nucleoskeleton and the unbroken template. This preparation can be manipulated freely without aggregation or breaking the DNA and yet is accessible to enzymes and other probes. The major activity, which is sensitive to aphidicolin, is found only in S-phase nuclei and replicates DNA semi-conservatively, forming intermediates that are ligated efficiently into larger products.

### [Biopsy of the rectal mucosa in pediatric surgery. Technic--diagnostic value. Apropos of 193 biopsies]
### 193 series of punch biopsy of the rectal mucosa for the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease using the histochemical method are reported. These biopsies concern 176 children from 4 days to twelve years old. The authors insist on the simplicity of the method which requires few equipment: nasal speculum and biopsy forceps. The pieces are carried fresh to the laboratory and treated immediately. The method uses the medium described by Karnovsky and Roots but enzymatic inhibitor of the non selective esterase activity is not used. This shortens the time of the manipulation to about 1 h 30 and limits its cost and toxicity. Three histologists have studied the slides without knowing the clinical facts. Of 36 children suffering from a Hirschsprung's disease all presented a mucosal AChE increased activity, 28 times at once, 8 times after further biopsies. In four patients there was an inadequate biopsy at the beginning of the experience, the other four were very young (less than 1 month). The biopsy was negative at the beginning but it became positive when the patients were about aged 3 months. In the 138 children not suffering of a Hirschsprung's disease, 2 had a AChE increased activity, One is a children suffering from a severe ganglionic displasia obvious on the surgical piece, the other is a colonic mucosal neuromatosis. So, the authors confirm the reliability of the simplified method which required an unsophisticated equipment and whose technique is faster looking for mucosal AChE increased activity and not for the ganglionic cells of the sub-mucosa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

### 10597033
### DNA computing the Hamiltonian path problem.
### The directed Hamiltonian path (DHP) problem is one of the hard computational problems for which there is no practical algorithm on a conventional computer available. Many problems, including the traveling sales person problem and the longest path problem, can be translated into the DHP problem, which implies that an algorithm for DHP can also solve all the translated problems. To study the robustness of the laboratory protocol of the pioneering DNA computing for the DHP problem performed by Leonard Adleman (1994), we investigated how the graph size, multiplicity of the Hamiltonian paths, and the size of oligonucleotides that encode the vertices would affect the laboratory procedures. We applied Adleman's protocol with 18-mer oligonucleotide per node to a graph with 8 vertices and 14 edges containing two Hamiltonian paths (Adleman used 20-mer oligonucleotides for a graph with 7 nodes, 14 edges and one Hamiltonian path). We found that depending on the graph characteristics such as the number of short cycles, the oligonucleotide size, and the hybridization conditions that used to encode the graph, the protocol should be executed with different parameters from Adleman's.

### 17961018
### Evaluation and management of Cushing syndrome in cases of negative sellar magnetic resonance imaging.
### The treatment of patients with Cushing disease and without magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evidence of Cushing disease (that is, negative MR imaging) is discussed in this paper. Magnetic resonance imaging is the diagnostic modality of choice in Cushing disease, but in up to 40% of these patients negative imaging can be caused by tumor-related factors and limitations in imaging techniques. In cases in which the MR imaging is negative, it is critical to make sure that the diagnosis of Cushing disease is correct. This can be accomplished by performing a complete laboratory and imaging workup, including dexamethasone suppression tests, imaging of the adrenal glands, and inferior petrosal sinus sampling when appropriate. If these evaluations suggest a pituitary source of the hypercortisolemia, then transsphenoidal surgery remains the treatment of choice. The authors favor the endoscopic approach because it gives a wider and more magnified view of the sella and allows inspection of the medial cavernous sinus walls. Radiosurgery is an effective treatment option in patients with persistent Cushing disease. When a target cannot be found on MR imaging, one can target the entire sellar region with radiosurgery.

### [Calcification of the falx cerebri. A pathognomonic symptom of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome]
### BACKGROUND: Gorlin-Goltz syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder with variable penetration characterized primarily by keratocysts of the jaws, multiple basal cell carcinomas, skeletal abnormalities and intracranial calcifications. METHOD: In this study, 4787 radiographs with occipitomental x-rays from the hospital archives for oral and maxillofacial surgery of the Christian Albrechts University Kiel were examined for calcifications in the area of the falx cerebri. RESULTS: Four characteristic alterations in the falx cerebri could be assigned to four groups of structures. Those in group 4 could be found only within Gorlin-Goltz syndrome patients, and differed significantly in form and extent from the remaining three groups. CONCLUSION: The plurilamellar appearance of this group could be rated as a pathognomonic symptom of the Gorlin-Goltz syndrome.

### 2066785
### Indium-111-labeled B72.3 monoclonal antibody in the detection and staging of breast cancer: a phase I study.
### Sixteen patients with primary breast cancer were studied with a pancarcinoma monoclonal antibody B72.3, an IgG1 molecule directed against tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG-72) present in several tumors. Five millicuries of 111In was used to label 0.2 mg (six patients), or 2 mg (six patients), or 20 mg using the site-directed bifunctional DTPA method (at carbohydrate moiety). Digital, planar, and SPECT images were obtained at 2, 48, 72 and 96 hr when possible. HAMA levels were obtained before the Mab infusion and at 1, 3, and 6 wk postinfusion. Fourteen of 14 known primary breast lesions were detected by imaging (100% sensitivity). Two fibrocystic lesions were negative. Seven of 14 patients had lymph node metastases by histologic methods, but all were missed by radioimmunoscintigraphy. Tumor uptake of Mab ranged 0.00054%-0.0038% of the ID/g. The tumor-to-normal breast tissue ratio was 4.3 +/- 0.91 (mean +/- s.e.m.). Lymph nodes localization of 111In-B72.3 by tissue analysis was similar for tumor-bearing and normal nodes (0.0039 +/- 0.0023 versus 0.0025 +/- 0.0019). Pharmacokinetics revealed mean plasma half-life of 33.3-41.2 hr for the different doses. There was no statistical difference between any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of different doses. HAMA was positive only in 17% of the patients. The study suggests that this antibody has 100% sensitivity for primary breast cancers, but very poor detection rate of metastatic lesions in axillary lymph nodes; thus making it of questionable value in the initial staging process of this disease.

### 16617726
### [The phenotypical review of patients with sleep apnea syndrome]
### Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is common with obesity. This may be a risk factor for the evolution of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders. The aim of the study was to estimate, how is the frequency of adiposity, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia by the SAS patients. Material and methods. On the basis of questionnaire SAS was suspected in 770 patients. The preliminary investigation was MESAM 4, and revealed 110 patients with desaturation during sleep. In all of them polisomnografic examination confirmed diagnosis. Glucose and lipides values and also description of: gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) was analysed. Conclusions: The analysis of the obtained results show the dependence of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and BMI, glucose and lipids values. The most frequent features in SAS patients is obesity, diabetes mellitus was the second one, hyperlipidemia was seldom observed.

### 17431856
### Observation of O-H...N scalar coupling across a hydrogen bond in nocathiacin I.
### We report here the observation of O-H...N hydrogen-bond (1h)J(N,OH) scalar coupling in a biologically active natural product. The intramolecular hydrogen bond between the threonine hydroxyl (Thr-OH) group and the thiazolyl nitrogen at the second thiazole ring (Thz-2) in nocathiacin I was directly detected by a 1H-15N HMBC NMR experiment. The magnitude of the scalar coupling constant (1h)J(N,OH) was accurately measured to be 1.8 +/- 0.1 Hz by a J-resolved 1H-15N HMBC experiment. By adding the O-H...N distance restraint, the 3D solution structure of nocathiacin I was refined. The structure refinement indicated that the distance between the Thr-3 hydroxyl hydrogen and the Thz-2 nitrogen is <or=2.50 A in all the refined structures, and there are no NOE restraint violations >or= 0.23 A. The presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond in nocathiacin I is further supported by a number of NMR parameters and additional NMR experiments. This observation provides valuable information for characterizing molecular conformations, and for studying structure-activity relationships.

### 7127405
### Calcium-sensitive cells of the pars intermedia and osmotic balance in the eel. II. Response to calcium-free sea water.
### Freshwater eels were adapted to calcium-free sea water (SW) or 1/3 Ca-free SW. Survival was generally poor in Ca-free SW, although three eels were still in good condition after 19-30 days; survival in 1/3 Ca-free SW was excellent. Osmotic disturbances (increase of plasma osmolarity and sodium levels), which initially occur in Ca-free SW, were no longer detectable after 19-30 days, or in eels in 1/3 Ca-free SW after one month. Plasma calcium sharply decreases initially; it is less depressed after 19-30 days and in 1/3 Ca-free SW. Alterations in the mucus production may be involved in the osmotic changes. Under these conditions no clear stimulation of the calcium-sensitive (Ca-s) cells of the pars intermedia was registered, but in Ca-free SW (1/3 or full strength) the inhibitory effect normally observed in SW does not occur. In a hyperosmotic environment, other ion(s), possibly magnesium, may reduce the response of the Ca-s cells to a lack of environmental calcium.

### Evolution of iron speciation during hydration of C4AF.
### It is now well accepted and demonstrated that calcium silicate, calcium aluminate and calcium sulfo aluminate (ettringite, AFm) phases exhibit a good capability to fix metals and metalloids. Unfortunately the role of minor phases and especially calcium-ferric aluminate phase, shorthand C4AF is not well defined. In other systems like in soils or sediments iron phases play a key role in the fixation of pollutant. In cement sorption isotherms, indicated that various metals can be retained by the C4AF hydrated products. Therefore the capabilities of those phase to retain heavy metal should not be neglected. Previous investigations have shown that the minerals formed during the hydration of C4AF are similar to those formed from C3A (pure tri-calcium aluminate) under comparable conditions. Nevertheless no investigation was conducted at the molecular level and there is still a controversy whether Fe substitutes for Al in the hydrated minerals in whole or in part, or if it forms FeOOH clusters scattered throughout the matrix. In this context we have conducted XAS experiments using synchrotron radiation. It was found that the hydration of C4AF forms C3AH6 (hydrogarnet) in which Fe randomly substitutes for Al as well as an amorphous FeOOH phase. Intermediate products like AFm (i.e., an ill organized lamellar phase) are also formed but rapidly evolve to C3AH6; iron does not seem to be incorporated in the AFm structure.

### Cognitive deficits in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and in liver transplant recipients.
### This study assessed cognitive deficit in patients diagnosed with different stages of hepatic cirrhosis and in liver transplant recipients. A short protocol consisting of several psychometric tests was used. Cirrhotic patients showed a degree of mental impairment in all the functions studied. The severity of the deficit was related to the degree of hepatic dysfunction. In contrast, liver transplant recipients presented only a slightly altered cerebral dysfunction in comparison to the control group. Their cognitive capacity was slightly better than that of patients with asymptomatic cirrhosis.

### Toxicity of the combined nerve agents GB/GF in mice: efficacy of atropine and various oximes as antidotes.
### The toxicity of a combination of isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate (sarin; GB) and cyclohexyl methylphosphonofluoridate (GF) and the efficacy of various oxime reactivators in combination with atropine against the combined GB/GF challenge were evaluated in mice. The 24-h s.c. LD50 of the GB/GF combination was 1.15 mumol/kg (1.10-1.21; 95% confidence limits). Mice administered GB/GF displayed typical signs of nerve agent poisoning such as tremors and convulsions, with death most likely due to anoxia subsequent to respiratory arrest. The GB/GF LD50 value was comparable to the s.c. LD50 of 1.35 and 1.21 mumol/kg for GF and GB in mice, respectively. Combining the two nerve agents did not result in potentiation of the toxicity. In combination with atropine sulfate (17.4 mg/kg, i.p.), which alone did not reduce mortality, the oximes tested, 2-PAM, obidoxime and HI-6, were all effective when administered 5 min before 3 x LD50 dose of GB/GF with 24-h ED50 values of 102.5, 18.22 and 1.96 mumol/kg, respectively. Use of the GB/GF combination does not appear to confer any unique toxicity profile and appears to be easily treated with the standard therapy of a cholinolytic and oxime.

### 11390204
### Melatonin reduces X-ray irradiation-induced oxidative damages in cultured human skin fibroblasts.
### Melatonin is a hormone with multiple functions in humans, produced by the pineal gland and stimulated by beta-adrenergic receptors. Melatonin has been shown to have radioprotection properties, but there has been little progress toward identifying the specific mechanisms of its action. To clarify the role of melatonin as a radioprotective compound, in response to X-ray irradiation, we investigated the effects of X-ray irradiation and melatonin on cytotoxicity, lipid peroxidation and alteration of the cell cycle in cultured skin fibroblast. An 8 Gy dose of X radiation resulted in cell death in 63% of irradiated cells, i.e. the cell viability was 37%. The damage was associated with lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane, as shown by the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA). By pre-incubation with melatonin (10(-5) M), a significant preventive effect was noted on the increase in the absolute number of surviving cells (up to 68% of cells were survived), and the levels of MDA were markedly decreased. These findings suggest a close correlation between an increase of lipid peroxidation and a rate of cell death. Morphological changes associated with apoptotic cell death were demonstrated by TEM. DNA flow-cytometry analysis revealed that X radiation increased pre-G1 apoptotic population by 7.6% compared to a very low level (1.3%) of non-irradiated cells. However, in the presence of melatonin, this apoptotic population decreased up to 4.5% at 10(-5) M. The p53 and p21 protein levels of skin fibroblasts increased 4 h after 8 Gy irradiation, but melatonin pretreatment did not change those levels. This study suggests that melatonin pretreatment inhibits radiation-induced apoptosis, and melatonin exerts its radioprotective effect by inhibition of lipid peroxidation and without any involvement of the p53/p21 pathway.

### 1120025
### Single coronary artery with myocardial infarction and AV block.
### A case of single coronary artery with myocardial infarction was found in a 77-year-old woman.  Study of the conductive system in this case did not show any abnormalities that could be correlated with the terminal clinical episode of heart block.  In seven anatomically proven cases reported, the single coronary artery arose from the right aortic sinus, which suggests a possible causal relationship to infarction.

### 6578998
### Does PGE2 have a beneficial effect on acute experimental pancreatitis in the rat?
### Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is known to have a cytoprotective effect on the gastric mucosa exposed to a variety of noxious agents. A cytoprotective effect on the pancreas in acute pancreatitis has been postulated, but available evidence is contradictory. Acute experimental pancreatitis was induced in 170 male Wistar rats by retrograde injection of 0.6 ml of 5% Na-taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. PGE2 (0.1 microgram/g rat) was given intraductally, intraperitoneally or subcutaneously before and after induction of pancreatitis. PGE2 had no effect on survival rate, enzyme levels in serum and ascites, or on morphologic damage to the pancreas.

### Automatic backscatter analysis of regional right ventricular systolic function using colour kinesis in patients with inferior wall acute myocardial infarction with or without right ventricular involvement.
### BACKGROUND: In patients with inferior acute myocardial infarction (AMI), right ventricular (RV) function is an important determinant of global cardiac performance, prognosis, and exercise capacity. Several echocardiographic methods for quantifying RV function have been developed over the years but the usefulness of colour kinesis (CK) and acoustic quantification (AQ) have not yet been investigated. AIM: To test whether AQ and CK may provide quantitative assessment of global and regional RV function in patients with inferior AMI. METHODS: Thirty two consecutive patients with recent inferior AMI with or without RV involvement (n=17 and n=15, respectively), and 15 age- and gender-matched controls were studied. The graphs of RV fractional area change were displayed along with ECG and the concurrent cross sectional image. CK digitised end-systolic images of RV and were evaluated by reviewing the stored loops obtained from normal subjects and patients. To evaluate the entire RV systolic endocardial excursion, further quantitative CK analysis was performed by measuring the systolic segmental endocardial motion (SEM). RESULTS: In comparison with the control group, patients with inferior AMI with or without RV involvement had reduced RV fractional area change (30+/-7%, 36+/-6%,45+/-6%, p<0.05, p<0.01 respectively), reduced mean free wall SEM (3.9+/-1.1 mm, 5.2+/-1.3 mm, 6.3+/-1.4 mm, p<0.05, p<0.01 respectively) and mean septal wall SEM (4.9+/-1.2 mm, 6.4+/-1.5 mm, 7.2+/-1.4 mm, p<0.05, p<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed that RV systolic functions are significantly more altered in patients with inferior AMI than in controls, and that RV abnormalities are more pronounced in patients with rather than without RV involvement. AQ and CK are able to detect wall motion disturbances in patients with inferior AMI with RV involvement.

### Effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on insulin signal transduction in rat adipocytes: relation to PKCbeta and zeta translocation.
### Although much evidence has been accumulated suggesting that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is an important mediator of insulin resistance, the precise mechanism involved is still unclear. Recently, it has been reported that insulin-induced glucose uptake is mediated by activation of second messengers such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and diacylglycerol (DG)-protein kinase C (PKC). We have examined the effect of TNF-alpha on insulin-induced glucose uptake and activations of tyrosine kinase, IRS-1, PI3K and PKC in rat adipocytes. Pretreatment with 0.1-100 nM TNF-alpha for 60 min resulted in a significant decrease in 10 nM insulin- or 1 microM 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake without affecting basal glucose uptake. 10 nM insulin-stimulated activation of tyrosine kinase, IRS-1 and PI3K was suppressed by preincubation with 0.1-10 nM TNF-alpha for 60 min. 10 nM TNF-alpha pretreatment also suppressed 10 nM insulin- and 1 microM TPA-induced increases in membrane-associated PKCbeta and PKCzeta. Furthermore, 10 nM TNF-alpha, by itself, altered PKCbeta translocation from the membrane to cytosol. These results suggest that TNF-alpha inhibits insulin-stimulated activation of both the tyrosine kinase-IRS-1-PI3K-PKCzeta pathway and DG-PKC pathway. Finally, TNF-alpha contributes to insulin resistance in rat adipocytes.

### 7310433
### Criteria for the diagnosis of the Guillain-Barr syndrome. A critique of the NINCDS guidelines.
### The publication of "official" criteria for the diagnosis of the Guillain-Barr syndrome designed for the purpose of aiding epidemiological studies, has resulted in excluding from consideration a number of fragmentary and atypical cases. Because it is a syndrome and not a disease entity, the limits are arbitrary. Several of the criteria are confusing and contradictory; they ignore a vast amount of literature which clearly documents the variability of the signs and symptoms.

### 16393347
### Single locus complementary sex determination in Hymenoptera: an "unintelligent" design?
### The haplodiploid sex determining mechanism in Hymenoptera (males are haploid, females are diploid) has played an important role in the evolution of this insect order. In Hymenoptera sex is usually determined by a single locus, heterozygotes are female and hemizygotes are male. Under inbreeding, homozygous diploid and sterile males occur which form a genetic burden for a population. We review life history and genetical traits that may overcome the disadvantages of single locus complementary sex determination (sl-CSD). Behavioural adaptations to avoid matings between relatives include active dispersal from natal patches and mating preferences for non-relatives. In non-social species, temporal and spatial segregation of male and female offspring reduces the burden of sl-CSD. In social species, diploid males are produced at the expense of workers and female reproductives. In some social species, diploid males and diploid male producing queens are killed by workers. Diploid male production may have played a role in the evolution or maintenance of polygyny (multiple queens) and polyandry (multiple mating). Some forms of thelytoky (parthenogenetic female production) increase homozygosity and are therefore incompatible with sl-CSD. We discuss a number of hypothetical adaptations to sl-CSD which should be considered in future studies of this insect order.

### 6861805
### First results of immunotherapy with immunoglobulin G in multiple sclerosis patients.
### 31 patients with multiple sclerosis were treated for an mean period of 4 years with high doses of human immunoglobulin. Overall, one third improved, one third showed no change and one third deteriorated. The effect of treatment was not related to any clinical or biological variable except perhaps the immunogenetic profile (HLA). The potential role of this symptomatic treatment is discussed.

### 242035
### The composition and flow of parotid saliva during acute hyperkalaemia in sodium-deficient sheep.
### Sheep were infused intravenously with 0-43 M-KCl at 2 ml/min for 2 hr while they were either sodium-replete or sodium-deficient after the unilateral loss of parotid saliva for 18 hr or 3 days. Salivary flow was depressed during potassium infusion and the flow rates observed at maximum hyperkalaemia were similar in all three states of sodium balance despite the large differences in flow rate before potassium infusion. The fall in salivary Na/K ratio during potassium administration was diphasic, the initial decline being slow and followed by a more rapid fall in the ratio. The duration of the initial period of slow decline in this ratio ranged from 75-105 min, 45-60 min, and about 15 min in the sodium-replete, mildly sodium-deficient and severely sodium-deficient states respectively. The decline in salivary flow during sodium depletion was associated with decreasing salivary bicarbonate concentration and increasing salivary phosphate and hydrogen ion concentrations with the concentration of chloride showing no consistent trend. During acute hyperkalaemia the chloride and phosphate concentrations were negatively correlated with salivary flow, the bicarbonate concentration was positively correlated with flow and the hydrogen ion concentration was unaltered. The sodium concentration of the saliva showed a statistically significant correlation with flow only when the sheep were severely sodium-deficient.

### 17899506
### [Ludwig II of Bavaria: schizotypal personality disorder and frontotemporal dementia?]
### Ludwig 2nd, dream-king of Bavaria, has been the subject of medical speculation even during his life and he still is today. Documents from the Secret Archive of the Bavarian State and more widely available information do not support a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but correspond with contemporary criteria for a schizotypal personality disorder. Ludwig's behavioural deterioration during the last months of his life and autopsy findings may indicate incipient frontotemporal degeneration.

### 3538860
### Nephrotoxicity induced by cancer chemotherapy with special emphasis on cisplatin toxicity.
### Renal failure in cancer patients is a common problem in oncology; this complication is frequently multifactorial in origin. Several antineoplastic agents are potentially nephrotoxic; previous renal impairment as well as combinations with other nephrotoxic drugs may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity during administration of chemotherapy. Methotrexate-related renal damage most frequently occurs with high-dose therapy and can be avoided by forced alkaline diuresis and administration of folinic acid. Renal dysfunction secondary to semustine (CH3-CCNU) is clearly related to cumulative doses in excess to 1,200 mg/m2; the onset may be delayed and renal failure progress despite drug discontinuation. Streptozotocin is also nephrotoxic and may cause proteinuria and renal tubular acidosis; progressive renal failure can be predicted by a close monitoring of proteinuria and prevented by drug discontinuance. Mitomycin-associated renal failure frequently presents with signs of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia; renal failure is usually delayed but occasionally, it may be rapidly progressive despite drug discontinuance. Cisplatin nephrotoxicity is clearly dose-related and used to be considered dose limiting. Renal insufficiency can be prevented by hydration and forced diuresis; in addition, hyperhydration with mannitol-induced saline diuresis may allow administration of high doses and thus circumvent the dose-limiting effect of cisplatin-induced renal toxicity. Cisplatin-induced renal magnesium wasting occurs frequently and should be supplemented. Other approaches to reduce cisplatin nephrotoxicity are currently under investigation and are discussed.

### 10987195
### Levels of C-telopeptide fragments of collagen type I enable the monitoring and early adjustment of clodronate therapy in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis.
### We monitored the efficacy of therapy with clodronate, a bisphosphonate drug, in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, using urinary immunoenzymatic assay of C-telopeptide of collagen type I, an eight amino acid fragment (collagen fragment) of the C-telopeptide of the alpha1-chain of collagen type I (EKAHDGGR). The analysis of the dynamics of collagen fragment concentrations (a marker of bone resorption) during treatment suggests the possibility of early modulation and customization of therapy based on the levels of this marker. This could enable improved control over secondary effects and side effects of clodronate therapy. Pharmacologic inhibition of bone resorption by osteoclasts could be indirectly responsible for the increase in parathyroid hormone found during treatment with clodronate. Increased levels of parathyroid hormone are probably necessary to stimulate residual osteoclast activity and are sufficient for the maintenance of calcium-phosphate homeostasis in a new pharmacologically-induced equilibrium. Outside this context the levels of parathyroid hormone of certain patients would be considered pathologic.

### 6200445
### In vitro studies involving histamine and lysosomal enzyme release from human peripheral leukocytes with different human serum albumin (HSA) preparations.
### Various batches of differently prepared human serum albumin (HSA) were tested for their capacity to induce in vitro release of histamine or lysosomal enzymes from peripheral human leucocytes. While there was little effect of most of the native preparations tested, some batches showed significant release of histamine or lysosomal enzymes after heating to 70 degrees C. HSA preparations produced by heat ethanol fractionation never induced significant release reactions. It is concluded that the mode of production and the selection of stabilizing agents might influence reactions of HSA with mediator-secreting cells.

### 8194511
### A microdialysis study of amino acid concentrations in the extracellular fluid of the substantia nigra of freely behaving GEPR-9s: relationship to seizure predisposition.
### Substantia nigra (SN) is known to play an important role in seizure generalization. Both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters can modulate this role of SN. Previous studies have shown that GABA as well as aspartate and glutamate participate in seizure regulation through this site. Evidence for such a role comes from studies on the genetically epilepsy-prone rat (GEPR) and other seizure models. In the GEPR, bilateral microinjections of NMDA receptor antagonists in SN block or reduce seizure severity. In order to further evaluate which neurotransmitters are specifically involved at the SN level of seizure regulation in the GEPR, we undertook a microdialysis study of K+ stimulated release of amino acids in the SN of GEPR-9s- and non-epileptic controls. A 1 mm loop-type microdialysis probe was inserted through pre-implanted guides into the SN of awake and freely moving rats (seven GEPR-9s and four non-epileptic controls), and used to perfuse a 100 mM K+ (high K+) solution for 2 h. Four 30 microliters samples were collected prior to high K+ stimulation (basal release), during high K+ perfusion, and after high K+ infusion. After precolumn derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate, levels of aspartic (ASP) and glutamic (GLU) acids, glycine (GLY), taurine (TAU) and GABA were measured by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Two hours after the initiation of high K+ infusion, the increases relative to basal were, for non-epileptic controls, 35%, 74%, 68%, 847% and 283% respectively for ASP, GLU, GLY, TAU and GABA. Corresponding increases for GEPR-9s were 14%, 10%, 41%, 505% and 123% respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

### 11250902
### The TRA-1 transcription factor binds TRA-2 to regulate sexual fates in Caenorhabditis elegans.
### The tra-1 and tra-2 sex-determining genes promote female fates in Caenorhabditis elegans. Classical genetic studies placed tra-1 as the terminal regulator of the pathway with tra-2 acting upstream as a regulator of regulators of tra-1. Here we report the surprising result that the TRA-1 transcription factor binds the intracellular domain of the TRA-2 membrane protein. This binding is dependent on the MX regulatory domain, a region of the TRA-2 intracellular domain shown previously to be critical for the onset of hermaphrodite spermatogenesis. The functional importance of the TRA-1-TRA-2 physical interaction is supported by genetic interactions between tra-1(0) and tra-2(mx) mutations: a reduction of tra-1 gene dose from two copies to one copy enhances the tra-2(mx) feminization phenotype, but has no apparent somatic effect. In Caenorhabditis briggsae, we also find an MX-dependent interaction between Cb-TRA-1 and Cb-TRA-2, but intriguingly, no cross-species interactions are seen. The conservation of the TRA-1- TRA-2 interaction underscores its importance in sex determination.

### 8864460
### Successful treatment of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPS).
### Severe veno-occlusive (VOD) disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients, and new approaches in managing patients who develop serious VOD is needed. In this report, we describe a patient who underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPS) for life-threatening VOD are following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for AML. Although the patient died of CMV-associated pneumonitis 5 weeks later, the TIPS functioned well until her death and permitted regression of the hepatic and renal symptoms. This report suggests that TIPS may be feasible and effective for managing patients with life-threatening liver dysfunction after marrow transplantation.

### 7849564
### Pretreatment with the polyamine analog 1,19-bis-(ethylamino)-5,10,15-triazanonadecane (BE-4-4-4-4) inhibits etoposide cytotoxicity in U-251 MG (NCI) human brain tumor cells.
### We studied whether pretreatment of U-251 MG human brain tumor cells with the polyamine analog 1,19-bis-(ethylamino)-5,10,15-triazanonadecane (BE-4-4-4-4) affected the cytotoxicity of the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. We found that BE-4-4-4-4 protected cells from the cytotoxic effects of etoposide. Possible mechanisms for this protection may be related to enhanced DNA-nuclear matrix association in analog-treated cells.

### 16597761
### Neurophysiology and neuroanatomy of pitch perception: auditory cortex.
### We present original results and review literature from the past fifty years that address the role of primate auditory cortex in the following perceptual capacities: (1) the ability to perceive small differences between the pitches of two successive tones; (2) the ability to perceive the sign (i.e., direction) of the pitch difference [higher (+) vs. lower (-)]; and (3) the ability to abstract pitch constancy across changes in stimulus acoustics. Cortical mechanisms mediating pitch perception are discussed with respect to (1) gross and microanatomical distribution; and (2) candidate neural coding schemes. Observations by us and others suggest that (1) frequency-selective neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) and surrounding fields play a critical role in fine-grained pitch discrimination at the perceptual level; (2) cortical mechanisms that detect pitch differences are neuroanatomically dissociable from those mediating pitch direction discrimination; (3) cortical mechanisms mediating perception of the "missing fundamental frequency (F0)" are neuroanatomically dissociable from those mediating pitch perception when F0 is present; (4) frequency-selective neurons in both right and left A1 contribute to pitch change detection and pitch direction discrimination; (5) frequency-selective neurons in right A1 are necessary for normal pitch direction discrimination; (6) simple codes for pitch that are based on single- and multiunit firing rates of frequency-selective neurons face both a "hyperacuity problem" and a "pitch constancy problem"-that is, frequency discrimination thresholds for pitch change direction and pitch direction discrimination are much smaller than neural tuning curves predict, and firing rate patterns change dramatically under conditions in which pitch percepts remain invariant; (7) cochleotopic organization of frequency-selective neurons bears little if any relevance to perceptual acuity and pitch constancy; and (8) simple temporal codes for pitch capable of accounting for pitches higher than a few hundred hertz have not been found in the auditory cortex. The cortical code for pitch is therefore not likely to be a function of simple rate profiles or synchronous temporal patterns. Studies motivated by interest in the neurophysiology and neuroanatomy of music perception have helped correct longstanding misconceptions about the functional role of auditory cortex in frequency discrimination and pitch perception. Advancing knowledge about the neural coding of pitch is of fundamental importance to the future design of neurobionic therapies for hearing loss.

### Nutrients, growth, and the development of programmed metabolic function.
### For each individual, the genetic endowment at conception sets the limits on the capacity or metabolic function. The extent to which this capacity is achieved or constrained is determined by the environmental experience. The consequences of these experiences tend to be cumulative throughout life and express themselves phenotypically as achieved growth and body composition, hormonal status and the metabolic capacity for one or other function. At any time later in life the response to an environmental challenge, such as stress, infection or excess body weight is determined by an interaction amongst these factors. When the metabolic capacity to cope is exceeded, the limitation in function is exposed and expresses itself as overt disease. During early life and development the embryo, fetus and infant are relatively plastic in terms of metabolic function. The effect of any adverse environmental exposure is likely to be more marked than at later ages and the influence is more likely to exert a fundamental effect on the development of metabolic capacity. This has been characterised as "programming" and has come to be known as "the Barker hypothesis" or "the fetal origins hypothesis". Barker has shown that the size and shape of the infant at birth has considerable statistical power to predict the risk of chronic disease in later life. These relationships are graded and operate across a range of birth weight, which would generally be considered to be normal, and are not simply a feature of the extreme of growth retardation. The first evidence showed strong relations between birth weight and heart disease, the risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and hypertension, and the intermediary markers for heart disease, blood cholesterol and fibrinogen. Strong associations have also been found for bone disease, allergic disease and some aspects of brain function. In experimental studies in animals it is possible to reproduce all of the metabolic features predicted from this hypothesis by moderating the consumption of food, or its pattern during pregnancy, and determining metabolic behaviour in the offspring. It has been shown that aspects of maternal diet exert an influence on fetal growth, especially the dietary intake of carbohydrate, protein and some micronutrients. However, these relationships are less strong than might have been predicted, especially when compared with the associations which can be drawn with maternal shape, size and metabolic capacity. Maternal height, weight and body composition relate to the metabolic capacity of the mother and her ability to provide an environment in which the delivery of nutrients to the fetus is optimal. Current evidence suggests that the size of the mothers determines her ability to support protein synthesis, and that maternal protein synthesis, especially visceral protein synthesis, is very closely related to fetal growth and development. It is not clear the extent to which the effect of an adverse environment in utero can be reversed by improved conditions postnatally, but some care is needed in exploring this area, as the evidence suggests that "catch-up" growth imposes its own metabolic stress and may in itself exert a harmful effect.

### 16426488
### Reasons why some UK medical graduates who initially choose psychiatry do not pursue it as a long-term career.
### BACKGROUND: Some doctors who initially choose psychiatry do not pursue it as a long-term career. The study seeks to identify reasons for leaving psychiatry. METHOD: Postal questionnaire survey of UK medical graduates of 1988, 1993, 1996 and 1999 identified as having left psychiatry; for comparison, doctors who left general practice or trauma and orthopaedics. RESULTS: Response rate was 74% (572/778); 488 respondents satisfied study criteria (59 psychiatry, 318 general practice, 111 trauma and orthopaedics). The speciality's poor public image, perceived lack of respect from medical peers, perceived threat of violence from patients, under-resourcing and low morale were problems for psychiatry leavers. Job stress, self-assessed unsuitability, and concerns about the lack of evidence-based treatments also influenced decisions to leave psychiatry. CONCLUSIONS: Early exposure to psychiatry may help trainees assess their suitability. Negative perceptions of workforce issues (e.g. low morale) and of clinical issues (e.g. perceived lack of ability to improve prognosis) need addressing to increase retention.

### Prefabrication of periosteal graft alone or with oxidised cellulose: an experimental study.
### The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of prefabrication of periosteal grafts, alone or with oxidised cellulose (surgicel), which was an osteoinductive material using femoral vasculature. Fifteen white New Zealand rabbits were used in both femoral regions (30 grafts), and randomly divided into three groups including five rabbits (10 grafts): the control group, the periosteal graft group, and the periosteal graft+surgicel group. A periosteal graft, 30 x 40 mm in size, was obtained from the calvarium of each rabbit. The periosteal graft taken was divided into two equal parts, 20 x 30 mm. All these periosteal grafts were sutured in the shape of tube. In all rabbits, femoral vasculature and periosteal tube was Included in a silicone tube. Additionally, in the control group, femoral vasculature was cut above and below the silicone tube, whereas in the periosteal graft+surgicel group, surgicel was added to the periosteal graft. The results were evaluated macroscopically and histopathologically in the second (two rabbits for each group - 4 grafts) and fourth week (3 rabbits for each group - 6 grafts). In the second week, In all three groups, while no osteoid tissue that indicated osteogenesis developed, it was seen that inflammation and increased vascularity occurred. Surgicel was observed to be absorbed in the periosteal graft+surgicel group. In the fourth week, fibrotic tissue was developed whereas inflammatory tissue disappeared; any osteoid tissue or lamellar bone was not accompanied in all three groups. In conclusion, we do not believe that periosteum was able to survive as a graft, and we found that neovascularization occurred too slowly to preserve the bone forming qualities of the periosteum. We suggested that it could not be prefabricated, being taken away from its donor site although surgicel was used as a stimulating material.

### Effects of storage time on incubating egg gas pressure, thyroid hormones, and corticosterone levels in embryos and on their hatching parameters.
### Incubating eggs (1,800 total) produced by a commercial flock of Cobb broiler breeders were used to determine the effects of storage duration (3 and 18 d) on gas partial pressure, thyroid hormones, and hatching parameters. Partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) and carbon dioxide (pCO2) were measured on d 18 and at internal pipping (IP) during incubation. Blood samples were collected for determination of triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and corticosterone concentrations in the embryos at IP and in newly hatched chicks. From 464 to 510 h of incubation, eggs were checked individually every 2 h to determine the timing and duration of IP, external pipping (EP), and total hatching time. At 18 d of incubation and at IP, pCO2 was greater in air cell of eggs stored for 3 d compared to those stored for 18 d (P < 0.05), but pO2 was greater in eggs stored for 18 d. At IP, T3 and corticosterone levels were higher in plasma of the embryos of eggs stored for 3 d compared to those stored for 18 d, but it was the reverse in newly hatched chicks (P < 0.05). Embryos from eggs stored for 18 d required more time to complete IP compared to embryos of eggs stored for only 3 d (P < 0.05), whereas the duration of EP was not affected by storage. The overall longer incubation was, however, not only due to prolonged IP but also to later occurrence of IP. It was concluded that prolonged IP as a result of long storage may be related to the late increase in corticosterone level, which may be a necessary stimulus for higher T3/T4 ratio, late increase in pCO2 level, and decrease in pO2. The effect of long storage was a delay in hatching and a continuous increase in T3 due to higher corticosterone levels between IP and hatching, which may be an indication of the more stressful event of hatching of embryos from eggs stored longer. Differences in pCO2, pO2, T3, T4, and corticosterone levels in the incubating eggs may be manifestations of these changes culminating in altered hatching parameters and consequently differences in chick quality and growth potentials.

### 11335734
### A randomized trial of alternative two- and three-dose hepatitis B vaccination regimens in adolescents: antibody responses, safety, and immunologic memory.
### OBJECTIVES: Hoping to increase hepatitis B (HB) vaccination of adolescents, we did the following: 1) studied if modified regimens of the recombinant HB vaccine, Recombivax HB (2 or 3 doses of 5 or 10 microg given over 4 or 6 months), induce protective anti-hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBsAb] levels (>/=10 mIU/mL) comparable to the recommended regimen (5 microg at 0 and 1, and 6 months); 2) measured early antibody response after a single dose; and 3) assessed immunologic memory after 2- and 3-dose regimens. DESIGN: One thousand twenty-six adolescents were randomized to 1 of 5 treatment groups (10 microg at 0 and 4 or 0 and 6 months; 5 microg at 0 and 6 or 0, 2, and 4 or 0, 1, and 6 months) in an open trial. Anti-HBsAb was measured in all participants just before and 1 month after the last dose, and at several other times in a subset of vaccinees. Anti-HBsAb response to a booster dose 2 years later was examined to assess immunologic memory in participants vaccinated with 5 microg at 0 and 6 or 0, 1, and 6 months. RESULTS: All regimens induced >/=10 mIU/mL of anti-HBs in >/=95% of vaccinees. Geometric mean titers ranged from 674.8 to 3049.4 mIU/mL. Geometric mean titers were higher with regimens using the following: 1) 10 versus 5 microg; 2) 3 versus 2 doses; and 3) vaccination intervals of 6 versus 4 months. After 6 months, 63.8% of vaccinees given one 10-microg dose had >/=10 mIU/mL of anti-HBsAb versus 41.6% after one 5-microg dose. Participants vaccinated with either two or three 5-microg doses retained robust immunologic memory. CONCLUSIONS:. The results of this study show that a 2-dose regimen of Recombivax HB is as immunogenic and induces immunologic memory as effectively as the recommended 3-dose regimen. A regimen of two 10-microg doses may be of significant benefit for vaccinees who are poorly compliant or deviate from the intended vaccination schedule.

### 17540403
### Carbacyclin induces carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 in cardiomyocytes via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) delta independent of the IP receptor signaling pathway.
### Prostacyclin (PGI2) and its analogues exert cardioprotective effects via the rhodopsin type membrane PGI2 receptor, IP. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) delta is a nuclear receptor abundantly expressed in cardiomyocytes and plays a pivotal role in maintaining constitutive mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO). Recently, a novel signaling pathway of PGI2 via PPARdelta has been demonstrated in non-cardiac tissues. We therefore examined whether carbacyclin (cPGI2), a PGI2 analogue, up-regulates transcriptional expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in mitochondrial FAO, via PPARdelta in cardiomyocytes. Intraperitoneal injection of cPGI2 increased CPT-1 mRNA expression in murine hearts. Transcriptional activity was evaluated by PPAR responsive element (PPRE)-luciferase reporter gene assay in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. CPT-1 mRNA expression and PPRE promoter activity were significantly increased by cPGI2 in a concentration-dependent manner, where PPRE has been mapped to the promoter region of the CPT-1 gene. Moreover, the elevation of CPT-1 mRNA expression and PPRE promoter activity by cPGI2 was not abolished by H-89, a potent protein kinase A inhibitor, but was significantly inhibited in cardiomyocytes over-expressing a dominant-negative type of PPARdelta. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that binding of PPARdelta to PPRE in the CPT-1 gene promoter is enhanced in response to cPGI2 stimulation. In addition, down-regulation of CPT-1 mRNA expression in cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia was attenuated by cPGI2. These results indicate that cPGI2 induces CPT-1 mRNA expression through PPARdelta, independent of the IP receptor signaling pathway, suggesting a possibility that cPGI2 modulates cardiac energy metabolism by activating FAO via PPARdelta.

### 3177278
### Plasma cell granuloma (inflammatory pseudotumor) of the breast.
### The first case of plasma cell granuloma (PCG) of the breast is presented. The lesion was seen as a circumscribed firm mass in the right breast of a 29-year-old woman. Histologically, a prominent plasma cell infiltrate was seen in a fibrous hyalinized stroma that contained spindle- and large stellate-shaped stromal cells with bizarre nuclei. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated the polyclonal nature of the plasma cells and characterized the stromal cells as myofibroblasts. The nature of these cells was confirmed ultrastructurally. PCG of the breast should be considered analogous to inflammatory pseudotumors of the lung and extrapulmonary sites.

### 11695830
### Biogenesis of respiratory complex I.
### Proteins specifically involved in the biogenesis of respiratory complex I in eukaryotes have been characterized. The complex I intermediate associated proteins CIA30 and CIA84 are tightly bound to an assembly intermediate of the membrane arm. Like chaperones, they are involved in multiple rounds of membrane arm assembly without being part of the mature structure. Two biosynthetic subunits of eukaryotic complex I have been characterized. The acyl carrier subunit is needed for proper assembly of the peripheral arm as well as the membrane arm of complex I. It may interact with enzymes of a mitochondrial fatty acid synthetase. The 39/40-kDa subunit appears to be an isomerase with a tightly bound NADPH. It is related to a protein family of reductases/isomerases. Both subunits have been discussed to be involved in the synthesis of a postulated, novel, high-potential redox group.

### [Congenital heart defects in children born 1981-1987 in the Bratislava District and surrounding countryside]
### In 1981-1987 of 61,420 liveborn children in the districts Bratislava-town and Bratislava-country 480 infants with inborn heart disease were born of whom 135 died. The mean incidence of congenital heart disease is 7.81% and the mean mortality 2.22%. During first week 42% of the 135 infants with congenital heart disease died. From an analysis of the deceased, operated and living candidate for operation the authors estimated 273 cardiological surgical operations for 216 children from the total of 480 with congenital heart disease. The results may serve as a basis for therapeutic and preventive care within the framework of the cardiovascular programme for children.

### Application of MRI for small intestinal diseases.
### Until recently, MRI has not been considered to be suitable for the evaluation of the small intestine due to artifacts associated with bowel peristalsis or respiration. However, recent advances of MR techniques enable the acquisition of clear images of the small intestine. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review the details for the application of MRI in patients with small intestinal diseases. This article discusses bowel preparation and oral contrast agents as well as MR techniques and pulse sequences. Thereafter, the usefulness of MRI for the lesions in the peritoneal cavity or in the gastrointestinal tract are discussed. Small intestinal lesions are categorized into inflammatory, neoplastic, ischemic, and obstructive bowel diseases. In conclusion, MRI can be used as an alternate modality of choice for imaging various diseases of the small intestine.

### Application of adjuvant-induced local hyperthermia for evaluation of anti-inflammatory drugs.
### A recently established method for determining the surface temperature of adjuvant-inflamed rat's paw was used to examine the anti-inflammatory potencies of various nonsteroidal and steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are currently in clinical use. The results were compared with those obtained by the carrageenin paw edema method and with the inhibitory potencies on prostaglandin E2 generation. The clinically effective single doses of the drugs were better correlated with the effective doses on local hyperthermia than with those on carrageenin paw edema, or with the inhibitory activities of the drugs on prostaglandin E2 generation from cultured rat synovial cells. Although care should be taken to avoid false-positive anti-inflammatory effects arising from vasoconstrictor activity or toxicity, determination of lowering effects on local hyperthermia in this inflammatory model may be useful for the evaluation of anti-inflammatory compounds.

### Feeding responses to selected alkaloids by gypsy moth larvae, Lymantria dispar (L.).
### Deterrent compounds are important in influencing the food selection of many phytophagous insects. Plants containing deterrents, such as alkaloids, are generally unfavored and typically avoided by many polyphagous lepidopteran species, including the gypsy moth Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae). We tested the deterrent effects of eight alkaloids using two-choice feeding bioassays. Each alkaloid was applied at biologically relevant concentrations to glass fiber disks and leaf disks from red oak trees (Quercus rubra) (L.), a plant species highly favored by these larvae. All eight alkaloids tested on glass fiber disks were deterrent to varying degrees. When these alkaloids were applied to leaf disks, only seven were still deterrent. Of these seven, five were less deterrent on leaf disks compared with glass fiber disks, indicating that their potency was dramatically reduced when they were applied to leaf disks. The reduction in deterrency may be attributed to the phagostimulatory effect of red oak leaves in suppressing the negative deterrent effect of these alkaloids, suggesting that individual alkaloids may confer context-dependent deterrent effects in plants in which they occur. This study provides novel insights into the feeding behavioral responses of insect larvae, such as L. dispar, to selected deterrent alkaloids when applied to natural vs artificial substrates and has the potential to suggest deterrent alkaloids as possible candidates for agricultural use.

### 6845955
### I.V. Labetalol during coronary artery surgery.
### The hemodynamic effects of a fixed dose of 10 mg i.v. Labetalol were evaluated in 9 CAD patients during a surgical procedure for myocardial revascularisation. The results show a significant mean decrease in heart rate (HR) (-13%), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (-16%) and rate pressure product (RPP) (-28%). Other hemodynamic parameters were not significantly affected. These results were confirmed by a clinical study where in a series of 110 CAD patients 21 were treated during the surgical procedure with incremental doses of Labetalol to control high systolic blood pressure and tachycardia. Administration of a mean dose of 24.3 mg of Labetalol resulted in a significant decrease of RPP (-38%). No side effects related to Labetalol were encountered.

### 8795720
### Participation of V beta 4(+)-, V beta 7(+)-, and V beta 11(+)-T lymphocytes in haematogenously acquired Staphylococcus aureus nephritis.
### The most frequent pathogen in haematogenously acquired kidney infections in humans in Staphylococcus aureus. In order to characterize in situ the immunological patterns of septic nephritis we developed a murine model of this disease. A single intravenous injection of S. aureus producing toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 resulted in high frequency of inflammatory kidney lesions. Histopathologically, both focal and diffuse inflammatory infiltrates were seen in kidney cortex and medulla. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed high numbers of Mac-1+ phagocytic cells as well as CD4(+)-and CD8(+)-lymphocytes. The expansion of lymphocytes carrying T-cell receptor V beta chain 4, 7, and 11 families in the kidney was observed. Our results suggest that the haematogenously acquired kidney infection by superantigen-producing staphylococci leads to migration, in situ activation and expansion of responding T-lymphocyte subsets.

### 11538291
### Determination of C1-C4 alkanes by ion mobility spectrometry.
### Flight instrumentation for the analyses of extraterrestrial environments must often perform under severely restricted conditions.  Often, the detection and identification of a multitude of chemical species is required to fulfill the scientific objectives of the mission.  It is therefore important that the analytical instrumentation have universal response.  The gas chromatograph-ion mobility spectrometer (GC-IMS) has the potential to provide the sample separation, identification and sensitivity necessary for a successful analysis.  However, the IMS has poor sensitivity for the C1-C4 alkanes.  The abundance of these molecules at various extraterrestrial sites is often of great importance to exobiologists.  This study focuses on optimizing IMS sample ionization mechanisms for the C1-C4 alkanes and other hydrocarbons of interest to exobiology.

### 16226141
### What happened to the care of older persons in Sweden? A retrospective analysis based upon simulation model calculations, 1985-2000.
### There is in Sweden a lack of national data connecting public care services to needs in various sub-groups. As result of these statistical deficiencies there has been a severe lack of solid facts to guide the public debate in Sweden concerning the developments of the old age care system. Also connected to this are the similar problems of predicting future needs development in order to estimate future burdens on the systems of care. A computer model has been developed that, by combining different national and local data sources, describes the development of the Swedish public system of care for older persons in terms of service provision and costs per needs group according to age, gender, marital status and degree of disability or ill-health. The model works in 5-year steps and has a retrospective part covering the period 1985-2000 and a prospective part for the period 2005-2030. In this article is described the structure of the model, assumptions, data sources and results for the retrospective part of the model. The model calculations show that despite of a large increase in the number of older persons there has not been a very substantial increase of needs. The number of persons with severe ill-health is basically unchanged, even if there appears to have been some shift in the composition of the group towards more heavy disability. The reductions in provided services, that the municipalities have been forced to do depending on the harsher economic conditions in Sweden since the beginning of the 1990s, have almost exclusively been targeted on persons with lesser needs. Those most in need have largely been shielded.

### The purpose of this retrospective study was to report clinical and clinicopathologic findings, response to treatment, and outcome of hypothyroid dogs treated with levothyroxine intravenously (IV). Seven levothyroxine IV treated hypothyroid dogs and 799 other hypothyroid dogs examined during the same period were included. Rottweiler dogs were overrepresented in the group of levothyroxine IV-treated hypothyroid dogs compared with other hypothyroid dogs (P < .0001). Common physical examination abnormalities were obese or overweight body condition (5 dogs), mental dullness (5 dogs), and nonpitting edema (4 dogs). Anemia (4 dogs) and hypercholesterolemia (5) were common, although 1 dog had neither. Concurrent disease (most commonly infection) was observed in 5 dogs. Glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs had been administered to 2 dogs before examination. Surgery was performed in 2 dogs before treatment with levothyroxine IV. Four of the 7 dogs received 4-5 microg/kg of levothyroxine IV. Subjective improvement in mentation or ambulation (6 of 7 dogs) and systolic hypotension (2 of 2 dogs) occurred within 30 hours of levothyroxine IV administration. Six of the 7 dogs responded well to therapy and were discharged from the hospital. It was concluded that physical examination and clinicopathologic findings of dogs with a hypothyroid crisis are nonspecific, although Rottweiler dogs may be at increased risk. Concurrent disorder, such as infection, concurrent administration of thyroid hormone-altering medication, and surgery, may be associated with development of a hypothyroid crisis. Resolution of abnormal mentation, ambulation, and systolic hypotension should be expected within 30 hours. Prognosis is good in most treated dogs.

### 15512847
### Polyclonal antibody effects on the human cardiac 5-HT4(e) receptors depend upon the expression system.
### The initial objective of this work was to examine the effects of an antibody (Anti-G21V) directed against the second extracellular loop of human heart 5-HT4 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The antibody anti-G21V had no effect upon either basal cAMP-or 5-HT-evoked increases in cAMP in CHO cells, whereas it had shown an agonist-like effect in COS-7 cells. Analysis of agonist fractions of h5-HT4(e) receptors in CHO and COS-7 cells revealed that equilibrium constant could underlie the different responses of the receptor toward the anti-G21V antibody. Therefore, different expression systems could give rise to functional differences in 5-HT4 receptor behavior.

### Tumor-promoting phorbol ester down-regulates the androgen induction of prostate-specific antigen in a human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line.
### Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most sensitive marker available for monitoring the progression of prostate cancer and response to therapy. In a previous study, we demonstrated tissue-specific expression of PSA glycoprotein and mRNA and its regulation through the androgen receptor. In this study, we examine the effects of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) on the androgen regulation of PSA in a human adenocarcinoma cell line, LNCaP. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that forskolin, an activator of PKA, had no effect on the androgen regulation of PSA. However, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a direct activator of PKC, showed a time- and dose-dependent repression of the androgen regulation of PSA glycoprotein and mRNA. The biologically inactive phorbol ester, 4 alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, had no effect. Staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, blocked the TPA-mediated repression of the androgenic stimulation of PSA glycoprotein. In addition, the calcium ionophore, A23187, was able to simulate the actions of TPA, presumably through activation of PKC via calcium mobilization. In summary, the androgenic regulation of PSA protein and mRNA is repressed by tumor-promoting phorbol esters through the PKC pathway. This indicates that the effects of TPA may be secondary to repressed gene transcription or altered mRNA stability. In addition, this study emphasizes that the androgenic regulation of PSA is complex and may involve other extracellular transduction signals.

### 11036797
### Quality of life of mothers and families caring for preterm infants requiring home oxygen therapy: a brief report.
### OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact on mothers and families of caring for a premature infant receiving home oxygen therapy (HOT). METHODS: Standard questionnaires were used to compare the functioning of mothers and families of 10 premature infants receiving HOT, 10 premature infants who were discharged from hospital on HOT but who no longer required it and 20 premature infants who had never required treatment with HOT. RESULTS: After adjustment for gestational age, chronological age, birthweight and place of residence (urban/rural), the care required by premature infants receiving HOT had a significantly greater impact on their families than the care of infants not receiving HOT. Mothers of premature infants receiving HOT reported significantly less vitality and more mental health problems than mothers of infants not receiving HOT. CONCLUSIONS: The use of HOT for premature infants may have a significant adverse impact on their mothers and families.

### Planning continuing training.
### Suggests new direction in the approach to planning continued training of medical personnel.  Under this new scheme, health problems themselves will be the sole basis for the planning of the continuing training program.  This approach assures the involvement of health professionals at various levels and fosters a multiprofessional involvement in continuing training.  It is also recommended that the preventive aspects of medicine be stressed far more than is typical of traditional hospital services.  The method for decision making in program planning includes 6 steps:  1) choice of health problem to be solved (includes considerations of severity of the problems and the degree to which continuing training will be of value); 2) analysis of the number and type of health personnel needed; 3) determination of desired skill acquisition; 4) analysis of teaching/educational requirements; 5) inventory of resources (time, facilities, staff, instructional materials) available; 6) evaluation.  Coordination at different levels, both national and regional, ensures the cohesion of the multiprofessional continuing training system.  Regional cell groups, composed of 2 paramedicals and a doctor administer continuing training sessions under policy established at a national level by a national advisory committee.  This approach makes continuing training an important and immediate component of health policy aimed at delivering basic health services to the entire population.

### 7143477
### Intestinal absorption and secretion of radioactive vanadium (48VO3-) in rats and effect of Al(OH)3.
### Vanadium in the metavanadate form (VO3-) is a powerful inhibitor of Na+, K+-ATPase. Because of the similarity between the oxy anions of vanadium and phosphorus, it was of interest to see whether Al(OH)3 would restrict the intestinal absorption of vanadium, as it does that of phosphorus. VO3- was extensively bound to a suspension of Al(OH)3 at pH 5-8. Sprague-Dawley rats (180-300 g) were fasted overnight and gavaged with 5 mumol Na3 VO4 in 1.0 ml 0.9% NaCl containing 1 microCi 48V. Control animals (n = 12) simultaneously received 1.0 ml diluent and experimental animals (n = 12) received 1 ml Al(OH))3. Diluent and Al(OH)3 were then given daily for 4 d. Urine and feces were collected separately each day. In control animals total 48V recovery (stool and urine) over 4 d was 86.6 +/- 2.4% of the administered dose. Although Al(OH)3 insignificantly increased total 48V recovery (93.6 +/- 3.2%), it markedly increased excretion of 48V in the stool as compared to the urine (control: stool, 69.1 +/- 1.8%; urine, 12.5 +/- 1.3%; Al(OH)3: stool, 85.7 +/- 1.5%; urine, 7.9 +/- 1.8%). Animals were then sacrificed and tissue uptake of tracer measured. The pattern of unexcreted 48V in tissue of both groups was kidney greater than bone greater than liver greater than intestine greater than muscle, but the tissue levels were uniformly higher in controls than in Al(OH)3-treated animals. The ability of Al(OH)3 to remove endogenous VO3- was also examined. 48V was injected ip (n = 20). Half of the animals received diluent and half received 1.0 ml Al(OH)3 by gavage daily for 4 d. There were no differences in the pattern of 48V tissue distribution and excretion. It is concluded that Al(OH)3 may prevent tissue accumulation of VO3- from dietary sources by reducing intestinal VO3- absorption.

### 2840706
### [Arterial DSA using a trans-brachial 4-French catheter]
### Arterial DSA by the trans-brachial route, using a 4-French-catheter has been performed in 33 patients. In these patients, trans-femoral DSA is contra-indicated because of previous surgery or markedly reduced femoral pulsation. Intravenous DSA was not expected to provide diagnostically adequate information in these patients, in view of the well known method limitations of this method. In 20 patients, the abdominal aorta, pelvis and lower limb arteries were examined, in 14 only the leg arteries, in ten patients the arteries in the neck and in three patients the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Trans-brachial DSA provided good demonstration of the vessels in all cases.

### 8615888
### Cellular fibronectin and von Willebrand factor concentrations in plasma of rats treated with monocrotaline pyrrole.
### The monocrotaline pyrrole (MCTP)-treated rat is a useful model for the study of certain chronic pulmonary vascular diseases. A single, i.v. administration of a low dose of MCTP causes pneumotoxicity, pulmonary vascular remodeling, sustained increases in pulmonary arterial pressure, and right ventricular hypertrophy in rats. The pulmonary vascular lesions are characterized by endothelial cell alterations, platelet and fibrin microvascular thrombosis, pulmonary edema, and thickening of the intimal and medial layers of the vessel wall. These lesions suggest that some dysfunction of the hemostatic system occurs in the lungs of rats treated with MCTP. We evaluated the concentrations of two adhesion proteins, cellular fibronectin (cFn) and von Willebrand factor (vWF), in the plasma of rats treated with MCTP. We hypothesized that changes in these factors occur along with markers of pneumotoxicity and ventricular hypertrophy and that such changes might contribute to the genesis of the vascular lesions. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure cFn and vWF concentrations in the plasma of rats after MCTP treatment. Rats treated with a single i.v. injection of 3.5 mg MCTP/kg body weight had delayed and progressive lung injury characterized at 5 days post-treatment by increases in the lung-to-body weight ratio and in lactate dehydrogenase activity and protein concentration in cell-free bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Values for these markers were further increased at 8 days and reached a plateau thereafter. The number of nucleated cells within the BALF was increased at 8 and 14 days. Right ventricular hypertrophy, an indirect marker of pulmonary hypertension, was evident at 14 days. The cFn concentration was increased in plasma in rats at 8 and 14 days after treatment with MCTP. There was no difference between the vWF concentration in plasma of rats treated with MCTP and those treated with vehicle at any time. We conclude that an increase in plasma cFn concentration occurs prior to the onset of right ventricular hypertrophy and that this change is consistent with a role for cFn in the genesis of vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension in the MCTP-treated rat. The lung vascular injury and pulmonary hypertension in this model were not reflected in altered vWF concentration in the plasma.

### End-stage renal disease in India and Pakistan: burden of disease and management issues.
### In the absence of national registries, no reliable data are available on the incidence and prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in India and Pakistan. The incidence of ESRD is likely to be higher than that reported from the developed world, with chronic glomerulonephritis being the most common cause, accounting for more than one third of patients, while diabetic nephropathy accounts for about one fourth of all patients in India. Patients are generally younger (mean age 42 years) at the time of detection of ESRD and two-thirds first see a nephrologist after they have reached end stage. Treatment of ESRD is a low priority for the cash-strapped public hospitals and in the absence of health insurance plans, less than 10% of all patients receive any kind of renal replacement therapy. The vast majority of patients starting hemodialysis die or stop treatment because of cost constraints within the first three months, and less than 2% patients are started on ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Although renal transplantation is the cheapest option, only about 5% of all patients with ESRD end up having a transplant. Living related donor transplants constitute 30 to 40% of all transplants in India, but there is a conspicuous gender bias with female donors donating kidneys for their male relatives. Cadaveric transplantation has yet to pick up and accounts for less than 2% of all transplants. The enactment of legislation to regulate renal transplantation in India has not been able to prevent unrelated (paid) donor transplants, which constitute 60 to 70% of all renal transplants. Cyclosporine, azathioprine and prednisolone continue to be the backbone of post-transplant immunosuppression, with cyclosporine being stopped in a significant proportion at one year post-transplant to cut down costs. Increasing awareness of renal disease amongst the population and general practitioners could result in early diagnosis of chronic renal failure and give opportunity for preventive strategies to delay the onset of ESRD. Preemptive transplantation and use of generic cyclosporine can help bring down the costs of treatment. Innovative and affordable health insurance policies can also increase the number of patients who receive effective treatment for ESRD in these two countries.

### 1222950
### Inhibitory effect of progesterone on the phytohaemagglutinin- induced transformation of human peripheral lymphocytes.
### Effect of sex steroids, progesterone and estradiol-17beta, on transformation of human lymphocytes induced by PHA was investigated. Responses of peripheral lymphocytes from non-pregnant women to PHA was markedly reduced in the presence of progesterone at a concentration of 10(3) or 10(4) ng/ml. Estradiol-17beta, on the other hand, had no effects on the PHA-induced transformation under the present experimental conditions. The immunosuppressive property of progesterone may contribute to depression of maternal cell-mediated immunity against fetus during pregnancy.

### 7575089
### [Person identification with video super-projection]
### The author reports on the identification of a male corpse which was found in a marsh where it had been lying for approximately three months. Autopsy revealed a laceration of the scalp with an underlying skull fracture. Since the corpse could not be identified by means of dental status, bloodgrouping or finger prints, the method of videosuperimposition was used. A comparison of the skull with a photograph of the suspected victim confirmed identity.

### 9773585
### [The treatment of hypospadias complexes]
### OBJECTIVES: To explain the preoperative assessment of the hypospadias cripple and define the fundamental principles of correction of the failed hypospadias repair. METHODS: Through case presentation and literature review, the defects associated with the failed hypospadias repair including persistent chordee, urethral stricture, urethrocutaneous fistula, urethral diverticulum, meatal retraction and stenosis, failed glansplasty are elaborated. Decision-making points in selecting a method of repair are also provided. RESULTS: The principles of successful reoperative hypospadias surgery are discussed and listed. CONCLUSIONS: A thorough assessment of the defect and precise application of standard principles of hypospadias repair allows for successful correction of even complex hypospadias cripples.

### 2800774
### [Qualitative description of cardiogram potentials of fetal body and respiratory movements in the non-contracting uterus]
### Cardiographic reflections of fetal movements were assessed using cardiogram synchronous ultrasonic examination in 44 normotrophic and 40 hypotrophic fetuses with body weights less than or equal to 10th percentile. The study showed that 90% of the fetal body movements were associated with accelerations in fetal heart rate. The degree of associated accelerations depended on the duration of the fetal body movements. In the hypotrophic fetuses the associated heart rate accelerations had a lower amplitude and a relatively longer duration. In impaired fetuses body movements were associated with decelerations in heart rate. Fetal respiratory movements resulted in an increasing beat-to-beat variability in the CTG. This effect did not occur constantly. During prolonged fetal respiratory segments no fetal body movements were observed and vice versa. Possible causes for the association between fetal movements and cardiogram are discussed.

### 9764557
### Isolation of a novel mycobacterium from an adolescent with cervical lymphadenitis.
### A slow-growing mycobacterium was isolated from a cervical lymph node of an adolescent male. This isolate produced small, smooth, scotochromogenic colonies after 6 weeks of incubation at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C (but not at 37 degrees C or 43 degrees C). The results of 16S-rRNA gene sequencing and high-performance liquid chromatography suggest that this isolate belongs to a hitherto unrecognised pathogenic species.

### 17547840
### Dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
### Cardiovascular disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). DM is now recognized as a risk equivalent for coronary heart disease. The lipid profile in patients with type 2 DM is characterized by elevated triglycerides, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) particles and is believed to be a key factor promoting atherosclerosis in these patients. Both primary and secondary prevention studies have provided ample evidence that aggressive statin therapy reduces cardiovascular end points in patients with DM. In all persons with DM, current treatment guidelines recommend reduction of LDLC to less than 100 mg/dL, regardless of baseline lipid levels. Lowering LDLC to less than 70 mg/dL may provide even greater benefits, particularly in very high risk patients with DM and coronary heart disease.

### 14570308
### Evaluation of the film-forming property of hydrogenated rosin.
### The film-forming and coating properties of a new biomaterial, hydrogenated rosin (HR), is investigated in the present communication. Films produced by casting method are studied for mechanical, (tensile strength, elongation, and Young's modulus), water vapor transmission, and moisture absorption characteristics. Type of plasticizer and its concentration were observed to play an important role in modifying the film characteristics. Dibutyl sebacate (DBS), a hydrophobic plasticizer, was found to be suitable for development of flexible and smooth films. Film formulations plasticized with DBS were investigated for coating the drug layered nonpareil seeds where plasticization facilitated development of smooth and uniformly coated pellets. The increase in coat buildup, however, did not sustain the drug release significantly. The studies conclude that HR films promise utility as moisture-protective hydrophobic, film-coating materials.

### 11065059
### Nutrients, growth, and the development of programmed metabolic function.
### For each individual, the genetic endowment at conception sets the limits on the capacity or metabolic function. The extent to which this capacity is achieved or constrained is determined by the environmental experience. The consequences of these experiences tend to be cumulative throughout life and express themselves phenotypically as achieved growth and body composition, hormonal status and the metabolic capacity for one or other function. At any time later in life the response to an environmental challenge, such as stress, infection or excess body weight is determined by an interaction amongst these factors. When the metabolic capacity to cope is exceeded, the limitation in function is exposed and expresses itself as overt disease. During early life and development the embryo, fetus and infant are relatively plastic in terms of metabolic function. The effect of any adverse environmental exposure is likely to be more marked than at later ages and the influence is more likely to exert a fundamental effect on the development of metabolic capacity. This has been characterised as "programming" and has come to be known as "the Barker hypothesis" or "the fetal origins hypothesis". Barker has shown that the size and shape of the infant at birth has considerable statistical power to predict the risk of chronic disease in later life. These relationships are graded and operate across a range of birth weight, which would generally be considered to be normal, and are not simply a feature of the extreme of growth retardation. The first evidence showed strong relations between birth weight and heart disease, the risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and hypertension, and the intermediary markers for heart disease, blood cholesterol and fibrinogen. Strong associations have also been found for bone disease, allergic disease and some aspects of brain function. In experimental studies in animals it is possible to reproduce all of the metabolic features predicted from this hypothesis by moderating the consumption of food, or its pattern during pregnancy, and determining metabolic behaviour in the offspring. It has been shown that aspects of maternal diet exert an influence on fetal growth, especially the dietary intake of carbohydrate, protein and some micronutrients. However, these relationships are less strong than might have been predicted, especially when compared with the associations which can be drawn with maternal shape, size and metabolic capacity. Maternal height, weight and body composition relate to the metabolic capacity of the mother and her ability to provide an environment in which the delivery of nutrients to the fetus is optimal. Current evidence suggests that the size of the mothers determines her ability to support protein synthesis, and that maternal protein synthesis, especially visceral protein synthesis, is very closely related to fetal growth and development. It is not clear the extent to which the effect of an adverse environment in utero can be reversed by improved conditions postnatally, but some care is needed in exploring this area, as the evidence suggests that "catch-up" growth imposes its own metabolic stress and may in itself exert a harmful effect.

### 7635763
### The detection of the mRNAs of procollagen types I, II and III in human fetal fingers by in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labelled oligonucleotide probes.
### Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding procollagen alpha 1 type I,alpha 1 type II and alpha 1 type III have been localized in paraffin sections of human fetal fingers using digoxigenin-labelled synthetic oligonucleotide probes. The probe-mRNA hybrids were visualized using an anti-digoxin antibody amplified with sandwich techniques. These protocols provided an excellent hybridization signal with minimal background noise. The sensitivity of the protocols was nearly equivalent to that seen when using isotopic cDNA probes. In human fetal fingers, intense hybridization signals for procollagen alpha 1 type I mRNA were detected in the osteoblasts and the fibroblasts of periosteum and perichondrium, the tenocytes of tendons, fibroblasts of ligaments, the synovial membrane and deeper layers of the dermis. In contrast, positive hybridization signals for procollagen alpha 1 type II mRNA were visualized in chondrocytes and the cambial layer of perichondrium. The signals for procollagen alpha 1 type III mRNA were detected in the fibroblasts of the dermis and perichondrium. The probes which have lower melting temperatures (Tm) could not detect the corresponding mRNAs.

### 10204447
### Classification, diagnostic criteria, and treatment recommendations for orofacial manifestations in HIV-infected pediatric patients. Collaborative Workgroup on Oral Manifestations of Pediatric HIV Infection.
### The criteria for diagnosis of HIV-related oral lesions in adults are well established, but corresponding criteria in the pediatric population are not as well defined. The Collaborative Workgroup on the Oral Manifestations of Pediatric HIV infection reached a consensus, based upon available data, as to the presumptive and definitive criteria to diagnose the oral manifestations of HIV infection in children. Presumptive criteria refer to the clinical features of the lesions, including signs and symptoms, whereas definitive criteria require specific laboratory tests. In general, it is recommended that definitive criteria be established whenever possible. Orofacial manifestations have been divided into three groups: 1) those commonly associated with pediatric HIV infection; 2) those less commonly associated with pediatric HIV infection; and 3) those strongly associated with HIV infection but rare in children. Orofacial lesions commonly associated with pediatric HIV infection include candidiasis, herpes simplex infection, linear gingival erythema, parotid enlargement, and recurrent aphthous stomatitis. In contrast, orofacial lesions strongly associated with HIV infection but rare in children include Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and oral hairy leukoplakia. Treatment recommendations, specific for this age group, have been included for some of the more common HIV-related orofacial manifestations.

### 17278022
### CD40-CD40 ligand signal induces the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression through nuclear factor-kappa B p50 in cultured salivary gland epithelial cells from patients with Sjgren's syndrome.
### The purpose of this study is to clarify signal transduction of expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) via CD40-CD40 ligand in salivary glands of patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS). We used cultured salivary gland epithelial cells (SG cells) from 15 SS patients and 8 controls obtained by labial minor salivary gland biopsy. First, ICAM-1 expression was determined with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry in the presence or absence of soluble CD40L (sCD40L). Next, SG cells were transfected with plasmids of pGL1.3-Luc inserted with promoter region of ICAM-1, pGL1.3kB(-)-Luc mutated in nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) binding site of pGL1.3-Luc and pNF-kappaB-Luc by lipofection method. Luciferase activity of the cells was measured in the presence or absence of sCD40L or sCD40L and an NF-kappaB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). Finally NF-kappaB family proteins of cell nuclear extracts were determined. ICAM-1 expression was significantly enhanced with sCD40L at the mRNA and protein level. Activity of pNF-kappaB-Luc and pGL1.3-Luc was significantly elevated by stimulation with sCD40L and suppressed by PDTC. NF-kappaB p50 protein level was elevated by stimulation with sCD40L and suppressed by PDTC. Our results suggest that sCD40L enhances the ICAM-1 expression by activation of NF-kappaB p50 in the SS SG cells.

### Signaling via histamine receptors in cat duodenal smooth muscle cells.
### Histamine produced concentration-dependent contractions in cat duodenal smooth muscle cells that were obtained by enzymatic digestion of smooth muscle with collagenase F. Pyrilamine, an H1 receptor antagonist, inhibited the contractile response while famotidine, an H2 receptor antagonist, augmented it. In cells with selectively preserved H1 receptors, produced by pretreatment with pyrilamine followed by inactivation of all unprotected receptors with N-ethylmaleimide, histamine-induced contraction was significantly augmented as compared with control cells. Pertussis toxin (PTX) had no effect on contraction, suggesting that the H1 receptor is coupled to a PTX-insensitive G protein. Gi2, Gi3, Go, Gs, and Gq subunits were present in cat duodenum, and histamine-induced contraction was inhibited by Gq antibody after cell permeabilization. Neomycin, a PLC inhibitor, inhibited the histamine-induced cell contraction, but not rhoCMB, a PLD inhibitor, or DEDA, a PLA2 inhibitor. Heparin, an IP3 receptor inhibitor, inhibited contraction whereas chelerythrine, a PKC inhibitor, had no effect. We conclude that histamine-induced contraction in cat duodenal smooth muscle cells is mediated by H1 receptors coupled to a PTX-insensitive Gq protein and results in activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC).

### 10698351
### The role of complement in transplantation.
### The complement system contributes critically to the barrier to transplantation of cells and organs. In the case of tissues and organs transplanted between individuals of the same species, that is in allotransplantation, the barrier posed by complement is seemingly eclipsed by the barrier posed by cellular immune responses. In the case of cells and organs transplanted between individuals of disparate species, that is xenotransplantation, the complement system has been thought to pose a nearly insurmountable barrier. With our understanding on how the complement system contributes to rejection, it is now clear that the complement system is more important in allotransplantation and more forgiving in xenotransplantation than was previously thought.

### 1657873
### Isolation, sequencing, and mutagenesis of the gene encoding cytochrome c553i of Paracoccus denitrificans and characterization of the mutant strain.
### The periplasmically located cytochrome c553i of Paracoccus denitrificans was purified from cells grown aerobically on choline as the carbon source. The purified protein was digested with trypsin to obtain several protein fragments. The N-terminal regions of these fragments were sequenced. On the basis of one of these sequences, a mix of 17-mer oligonucleotides was synthesized. By using this mix as a probe, the structural gene encoding cytochrome c553i (cycB) was isolated. The nucleotide sequence of this gene was determined from a genomic bank. The N-terminal region of the deduced amino acid sequence showed characteristics of a signal sequence. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature protein, the calculated molecular weight is 22,427. The gene encoding cytochrome c553i was mutated by insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene. As a consequence of the mutation, cytochrome c553i was absent from the periplasmic protein fraction. The mutation in cycB resulted in a decreased maximum specific growth rate on methanol, while the molecular growth yield was not affected. Growth on methylamine or succinate was not affected at all. Upstream of cycB the 3' part of an open reading frame (ORF1) was identified. The deduced amino acid sequence of this part of ORF1 showed homology with methanol dehydrogenases from P. denitrificans and Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. In addition, it showed homology with other quinoproteins like alcohol dehydrogenase from Acetobacter aceti and glucose dehydrogenase from both Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Escherichia coli. Immediately downstream from cycB, the 5' part of another open reading frame (ORF2) was found. The deduced amino acid sequence of this part of ORF2 showed homology with the moxJ gene products from P. denitrificans and M. extorquens AM1.

### Indium-111-labeled B72.3 monoclonal antibody in the detection and staging of breast cancer: a phase I study.
### Sixteen patients with primary breast cancer were studied with a pancarcinoma monoclonal antibody B72.3, an IgG1 molecule directed against tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG-72) present in several tumors. Five millicuries of 111In was used to label 0.2 mg (six patients), or 2 mg (six patients), or 20 mg using the site-directed bifunctional DTPA method (at carbohydrate moiety). Digital, planar, and SPECT images were obtained at 2, 48, 72 and 96 hr when possible. HAMA levels were obtained before the Mab infusion and at 1, 3, and 6 wk postinfusion. Fourteen of 14 known primary breast lesions were detected by imaging (100% sensitivity). Two fibrocystic lesions were negative. Seven of 14 patients had lymph node metastases by histologic methods, but all were missed by radioimmunoscintigraphy. Tumor uptake of Mab ranged 0.00054%-0.0038% of the ID/g. The tumor-to-normal breast tissue ratio was 4.3 +/- 0.91 (mean +/- s.e.m.). Lymph nodes localization of 111In-B72.3 by tissue analysis was similar for tumor-bearing and normal nodes (0.0039 +/- 0.0023 versus 0.0025 +/- 0.0019). Pharmacokinetics revealed mean plasma half-life of 33.3-41.2 hr for the different doses. There was no statistical difference between any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of different doses. HAMA was positive only in 17% of the patients. The study suggests that this antibody has 100% sensitivity for primary breast cancers, but very poor detection rate of metastatic lesions in axillary lymph nodes; thus making it of questionable value in the initial staging process of this disease.

### [Possible identification of electroencephalographic changes caused by hereditary and process factors in schizophrenia]
### A comparative study of the quantitative differences of EEG parameters in the pairs of mono- and dizygotic twins suffering from schizophrenia has shown that the magnitudes of some parameters were substantially lower in the monozygotic twins than in the dizygotic ones. Examinations of healthy relatives of the schizophrenic twins revealed an increased frequency of the same signs (in the magnitude and direction), as in the patients. Less distinct in the mono- dizygotic pairs were differences between the reactive changes of the biopotentials and the latter's spatio-temporal organization inside the pairs. In the monozygotic pairs, these changes and organization were disturbed to a greater degree in the twin partner with a more rapid progress of the disease.

### 17071083
### Aerobic granulation with brewery wastewater in a sequencing batch reactor.
### Aerobic granular sludge was cultivated in a sequencing batch reactor fed with brewery wastewater. After nine-week operation, stable granules with sizes of 2-7 mm were obtained. With the granulation, the SVI value decreased from 87.5 to 32 mL/g. The granular sludge had an excellent settling ability with the settling velocity over 91 m/h. Aerobic granular sludge exhibited good performance in the organics and nitrogen removal from brewery wastewater. After granulation, high and stable removal efficiencies of 88.7% COD(t), 88.9% NH(4)(+)-N were achieved at the volumetric exchange ratio of 50% and cycle duration of 6h. The average COD(t) and COD(s) of the effluent were 212 and 134 mg/L, respectively, and the average effluent ammonium concentration was less than 14.4 mg/L. Nitrogen was removed due to nitrification and simultaneous denitrification in the inner core of granules.

### 6756276
### Physical training in juvenile diabetes.
### In normal man, physical training increase insulin binding to receptors and body sensitivity to insulin in vivo. In addition, serum lipid and lipoprotein profile changes which may decrease the risk for coronary heart disease. In juvenile onset diabetics, insulin requirements fall during physical training, the mechanism of this decline being yet unknown. There are no prospective studies regarding the prognostic effects of physical training in juvenile diabetes. However, if physical training can improve metabolic control and enhance body sensitivity to insulin resulting in lowered levels of plasma insulin, this may reduce the risk for both micro- and macrovascular complications. The possible adverse effects of exercise, hypoglycemia and excessive rise in counterregulatory hormones can be largely avoided by adequate insulin therapy.

### Advanced prostatic carcinoma: pulmonary manifestations.
### To clarify the role of standard chest radiography in prostatic adenocarcinoma, the pulmonary manifestations of 198 patients with Stage D disease were evaluated. All patients were treated with chemotherapeutic protocols allowing for adequate clinical and radiographic correlation. Retrospective interpretation of serial chest radiographs revealed that 35% of our patients had visible intrathoracic abnormalities; however, only 24% of the patients had abnormalities attributable to intrathoracic metastases. Twenty-two percent of patients had pleural effusions, 16% reticular opacities, 3.5% reticulonodular opacities, 8% isolated or discrete pulmonary nodules, and 4.5% adenopathy. Etiologies of these opacities included metastatic disease in 93.5% of those with adenopathy and nodular or reticulonodular opacities, but 39% of pleural effusions and 52% of reticular opacities were best attributed to concomitant processes. Four patients had intrathoracic metastases without bone metastases. Standard chest radiography is a valuable screening procedure that should be correlated with clinical data to differentiate metastases from concomitant processes.

### 14683369
### Observation of anomalous momentum transport in tokamak plasmas with no momentum input.
### Anomalous momentum transport has been observed in Alcator C-Mod tokamak plasmas through analysis of the time evolution of core impurity toroidal rotation velocity profiles. Following the L-mode to EDA (enhanced D(alpha)) H-mode transition, the ensuing cocurrent toroidal rotation velocity, which is generated in the absence of any external momentum source, is observed to propagate in from the edge plasma to the core. The steady state toroidal rotation velocity profiles are relatively flat and the momentum transport can be simulated with a simple diffusion model. Velocity profiles during edge localized mode free (ELM-free) H-modes are centrally peaked, which suggests the addition of inward momentum convection. In all operating regimes the observed momentum diffusivities are much larger than the neoclassical values.

### 12689273
### Does the sun shine by pp or CNO fusion reactions?
### We show that solar neutrino experiments set an upper limit of 7.8% (7.3% including the recent KamLAND measurements) to the fraction of energy that the Sun produces via the CNO fusion cycle, which is an order of magnitude improvement upon the previous limit. New experiments are required to detect CNO neutrinos corresponding to the 1.5% of the solar luminosity that the standard solar model predicts is generated by the CNO cycle.

### 9681194
### Use of Indo-1FF for measurements of rapid micromolar cytoplasmic free Ca2+ increments in a single smooth muscle cell.
### A low-affinity fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Indo-1FF was used to measure cytoplasmic Ca2+ increments in single smooth muscle cells isolated from the urinary bladder of the guinea-pig. The in vitro Kd of Indo-1FF for Ca2+ measured at the microscope stage was 21 microM. Calibration parameters measured in the cell differed substantially from respective in vitro values suggesting that the properties of the cytoplasmic dye had been altered. Addition of proteins (aldolase or albumin) increased the in vitro F405/F495 ratio close to the range observed intracellularly. Emission spectra of Ca(2+)-free Indo-1FF demonstrated a blue-shift of 29 nm with 10 mg/ml aldolase and 60 nm with 10 mg/ml albumin. The Kd value of Indo-1FF for Ca2+ in vitro was not changed by addition of aldolase (up to 20 mg/ml) and was approximately doubled in the presence of 20 mg/ml albumin. Intracellular calibration either by skinning the cells with beta-escine, 'opening' the cell or by intracellular perfusion of 100 microM free Ca2+ (40 mM DPTA-Ca2+ buffer) suggest that the affinity of intracellular Indo-1FF for Ca2+ is not markedly changed. The Indo-1FF concentration of 20 microM in the patch-pipette was found to be a reasonable compromise between acceptable signal-to-noise ratio and increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering. This is because neither the amplitude nor the time-course of depolarization-induced micromolar Ca2+ increments were significantly changed during cell loading with this concentration of the dye. In contrast to Indo-1 loaded cells where rapid changes of [Ca2+]i were buffered, in Indo-1FF loaded cells ICa evoked rapid (rate of rise 150 microM/s) and large (4-6 microM in 35-60 ms) increments of free Ca2+. This results suggest that [Ca2+]i increments in smooth muscle cells are fast and large.

### 1591500
### Anger, depression and self-concept in adults with mental retardation.
### Self-report measures of anger, depression and self-concept that were designed for non-retarded children were adapted for adults with mental retardation. The measures were administered to 130 adults with mental retardation who lived in the community. Informants rated the subjects on shortened forms of the three emotional indices. Informant self-concept ratings were negatively correlated with ratings of anger and depression. On the self-report measures, subjects who reported low self-concept also reported high levels of depression. Mildly mentally retarded subjects were more likely to report anger than severe/moderately retarded subjects. Informant and self-report measures were significantly correlated for self-concept and depression, but not for anger. The results provide preliminary normative data on indices of emotional adjustment for community-based adults with mental retardation.

### 17710702
### Towards a global human embryonic stem cell bank.
### An increasingly unbridgeable gap exists between the supply and demand of transplantable organs. Human embryonic stem cell technology could solve the organ shortage problem by restoring diseased or damaged tissue across a range of common conditions. However, such technology faces several largely ignored immunological challenges in delivering cell lines to large populations. We address some of these challenges and argue in favor of encouraging contribution or intentional creation of embryos from which widely immunocompatible stem cell lines could be derived. Further, we argue that current immunological constraints in tissue transplantation demand the creation of a global stem cell bank, which may hold particular promise for minority populations and other sub-groups currently marginalized from organ procurement and allocation systems. Finally, we conclude by offering a number of practical and ethically oriented recommendations for constructing a human embryonic stem cell bank that we hope will help solve the ongoing organ shortage problem.

### Update on prostate cancer chemoprevention.
### BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men. Its high rate of occurrence and long lead time to clinically significant disease make prostate cancer an ideal disease for pharmacologic or nutritional chemoprevention. METHODS: To identify the various chemoprevention strategies for prostate cancer, a MEDLINE search (from 1967-2005) and bibliographic search of the English-language literature were conducted. RESULTS: Epidemiologic and retrospective studies have assessed the effect of carotenoids (e.g., lycopene), vitamins, selenium, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the rate of occurrence of prostate cancer. The few published prospective trials evaluated prostate cancer as a secondary end point. Lycopene (as beta-carotene) and selenium supplementation have been associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer in nested case-control studies, but only in subgroups of men with low baseline plasma lycopene (or beta-carotene) and selenium levels respectively. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial prospectively evaluated finasteride, a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, as chemoprevention. The results showed a 25% relative risk reduction in prostate cancer, albeit at an increased risk of invasive tumors. CONCLUSION: Data regarding lycopene, vitamin E, and selenium as chemoprevention for prostate cancer appear promising. Prospective trials such as the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) will clarify the role of these agents in prostate cancer prevention. The role of NSAIDs is unclear, and the long-term toxicity associated with NSAIDs may limit their usefulness. Although finasteride has decreased overall prostate cancer occurrence, the risk of invasive tumors may outweigh the benefit of this agent. The continuing Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial may help define a role for the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors in cancer chemoprevention. At this time, nothing has been proven effective as chemoprevention against clinically significant prostate cancer.

### 6517819
### Hypnosis in the investigation of aviation accidents.
### The efficacy of hypnotic inquiry techniques with ten witnesses to six recent Naval aircraft accidents was evaluated in this study. Eight witnesses had been directly involved in an accident, five as mishap pilots. Interviews were conducted under conservative standards of practice after regular interviews had been completed and all depositions taken. Naval officers who accompanied the witness(es) to the interviews and concomitantly assisted the accident investigation boards served as the evaluators. Important information concerning the accidents was gained in the majority of the interviews. Secondary survival information of importance was obtained in a number of cases as well. None of the witnesses experienced psychological or career problems as a result of the interviews, and the hypnosis seemed highly therapeutic in some cases. Results suggest that hypnotic interview techniques with witnesses may be of great value in the investigations of certain aircraft accidents.

### 14678894
### [Effect of simulated ischemia on activity and heterogeneity of Na+ channel in rabbit ventricular epicardial, midmyocardial and endocardial myocytes]
### OBJECTIVE: To study the ionic mechanism of reentrant arrhythmia. METHODS: Single myocytes were enzymatically isolated from the epicardium, midmyocardium and endocardium of the left ventricle free wall of rabbit, followed by whole-cell patch-clamp recording of the Na(+) current (I(Na)) of the 3 cellular subtypes (superfused with normal and then simulated ischemia solution). The currents in the 3 cellular subtypes before and after simulated ischemia lasting for 10, 20, and 30 min, respectively, were compared. RESULTS: No changes was recorded in the configuration of the I-V curves and voltage dependence of I(Na) after simulated ischemia, and the peak I(Na) densities (- 20 mV) were significantly reduced in the 3 cellular subtypes compared with those recorded in normal condition. At the same time, the differences in I(Na) peak current densities in the 3 cellular subtypes underwent variations after simulated ischemia. Simulated ischemia resulted in obvious shift of I(Na) steady-state inactivation curves in the hyperpolarizing direction in the 3 cellular subtypes and inactivation was accelerated, and the differences in the half maximal inactivation voltages (V0.5) between the 3 cellular subtypes were also altered after simulated ischemia. After simulated ischemia, I(Na) recovery from inactivation in the epicardium, endocardium and midmyocardium was all slowed down in comparison with that in normal condition, but without statistical significance. Differences between the recovery curves of three cellular subtypes were noted after ischemia for 30 min. CONCLUSION: Ischemia can affect the activity of Na(+) channel, disrupting the balance of ion channel currents and the heterogeneity of I(Na) among the 3 cellular subtypes, which is responsible for the onset of arrhythmia and partially explains different pharmacological reactions of the 3 cellular subtypes under normal and ischemic conditions.

### The beta3-adrenergic agonist CL316,243 inhibits insulin signaling but not glucose uptake in primary human adipocytes.
### Insulin resistance and obesity are central components of the metabolic syndrome which has become the leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Direct interactions of the beta (3)-adrenoceptor system with adipocyte signaling and function in humans remain poorly understood. However, this might have important consequences for the regulation of energy homeostasis and insulin resistance in states of hyperinsulinemia and sympatho-adrenergic overactivity. We therefore investigated beta (3)-adrenoceptor-mediated effects on insulin signaling and glucose uptake in mammary adipocytes of healthy women that underwent breast reduction surgery. Glucose uptake was strongly induced by insulin stimulation. This was paralleled by robust induction of insulin receptor kinase activity, insulin receptor substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity, and protein kinase B phosphorylation. Treatment with the beta (3)-adrenoceptor-selective agonist CL316,243 alone, neither induced alterations in the early insulin signaling cascade nor changed the basal level of glucose uptake. By contrast, pretreatment with the beta (3)-adrenoceptor agonist inhibited the insulin-induced insulin receptor substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity by 50 % and protein kinase B phosphorylation by 40 % without affecting insulin receptor kinase activity upstream. However, on the functional level insulin-induced glucose uptake remained unchanged by beta (3)-adrenoceptor stimulation. Our data demonstrate an insulin receptor-independent negative influence of beta (3)-adrenoceptor stimulation on proximal insulin signaling. This inhibition is apparently dissociated from glucose uptake in human adipocytes.

### 12947020
### High plasma phospholipid transfer protein levels as a risk factor for coronary artery disease.
### OBJECTIVE: Plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) mediates both net transfer and exchange of phospholipids between different lipoproteins. Animal studies have shown that it is closely related to the development of atherosclerosis. PLTP-deficient mice have demonstrated increased antioxidation potential as well as a decrease in apolipoprotein B secretion and atherosclerotic lesions. In humans, high PLTP is associated with type II diabetes and obesity. METHODS AND RESULTS: To assess the relationship between PLTP activity and coronary artery disease (CAD), a novel, high-throughput method to measure plasma PLTP activity was used, relating it to CAD in 1102 cases and 444 controls. This demonstrated that PLTP activity in patients with CAD was significantly higher than in controls (25.5 versus 22.4 pmol/microL per h; P<0.0001). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, PLTP activity was found to have independent predictive value for CAD. Patients within the highest quintile of PLTP activity revealed a 1.9-fold increase in risk for CAD compared with patients within the lowest quintile. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that PLTP activity is positively and independently related to CAD and suggest that (1) prospective studies to evaluate this relationship are warranted and (2) PLTP should be considered a therapeutic target.

### 6819525
### Semipermeable membrane tubes: a prospective study.
### Four years ago, we introduced the use of Castelli membrane tubes into our practice. Although initial reports in the literature and restrictions on indications from the manufacturer on use were extremely cautionary, we were able, by careful intraoperative technique and the use of postoperative antibiotics, to expand the use of the membrane tube and offer it to our entire patient population. To document this, we used a prospective study of 124 consecutive ears receiving a membrane tube. Follow-up study included clinical, audiometric, and tympanometric evaluation. We found the membrane tube to function extremely well in an extremely high percentage of ears, regardless of whether the ear contains serous or mucoid fluid. The advantages of membrane tubes include the lack of special care required, resultant high patient and parental acceptance, and the low incidence of draining ears with tubes in place.

### 16232893
### Cytochrome P450rm of Rhodotorula functions in the beta-ketoadipate pathway for dissimilation of L-phenylalanine.
### The physiological function of a microsomal cytochrome P450, P450rm, from Rhodotorula minuta was determined. We obtained a mutant, 5-286, which has a point mutation in the P450rm gene, resulting in loss of the activities of the isobutene-forming enzyme and benzoate 4-hydroxylase and the ability to grow on medium containing L-phenylalanine as the sole carbon source. Mutant 5-286 spontaneously reverted to the wild-type at a frequency of approximately 10(-9)-10(-10). These results indicate that P450rm functions in the dissimilation pathway starting from L-phenylalanine.

### 266723
### Inhibition of transcription and translation of globin messenger RNA in dimethyl sulfoxide-stimulated Friend erythroleukemic cells treated with interferon.
### The addition of appropriate doses of interferon (IF) to cultures of Friend erythroleukemic cells inhibits dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)-stimulated erythroid differentiation. In this study, the synthesis of heme, hemoglobin, and globin mRNA in Me2SO-stimulated cultures, with or without IF added, was compared. Although the hemoglobin content in Me2SO+IF-treated cultures was reduced 6- to 9-fold compared to that of cultures treated with Me2SO alone, there was less than a 2-fold decrease in the amount of heme accumulated. Globin mRNA, although unchanged in size or base sequence, was reduced in content in the Me2SO+IF cultures. The level of reduction of globin mRNA was insufficient to account for the lack of globin synthesis. Thus, it appears that IF may operate on two levels--one involving the transcription of globin mRNA and the other involving its translation.

### 8748109
### What's in an oath?
### Contrary to popular belief, the Hippocratic Oath (the Oath) is no fixed and unalterable document of medical ethics, but has been constantly modified over the centuries. Nor was it ever widely sworn or imposed as a condition for obtaining a degree or entering practice. The earliest certain evidence for the Oath taken in a university comes from 1558, and not until 1804 is there evidence for it being sworn by graduands or students. The demand for medical oaths and declarations is largely a feature of the second half of the twentieth century, favoured by physicians but often viewed with suspicion by patients.

### 9321910
### Induction of calcyclin after ischemic injury to rat kidney.
### Genes differentially expressed after acute renal ischemic injury were identified using differential display-polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR). Messenger RNA for calcyclin, a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, is increased in kidneys by 6 h following ischemic injury to rats compared with sham surgery. The level of calcyclin mRNA is increased 10-fold by 1 day postinjury and declines thereafter. In situ hybridization demonstrates little calcyclin mRNA in kidneys of sham-operated rats. However, calcyclin protein is present in glomeruli and distal tubules (DT). Compared with kidneys from sham-operated controls, both calcyclin mRNA and protein expression are increased at 1-3 days following ischemic injury in the thick ascending limb of Henle, the DT, and in damaged regenerating segments of proximal tubules. By 7 days postischemia there is a reduction in mRNA and protein expression. Calcyclin could play a role in the regulation of renal cell proliferation and regeneration in the recovery process after acute ischemic injury.

### 12045437
### Regional cardiac sympathetic denervation and systolic compression of a septal perforator branch in a sudden death survivor with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous primary cardiac disease with a broad clinical spectrum, including a high risk for sudden death in a certain subgroup of patients. However, the precise criteria for identifying the subgroup at high risk have not been established. The authors describe a 41-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who was examined after an episode of aborted sudden death. Extensive invasive and noninvasive investigations did not reveal a cardiac abnormality other than severe sympathetic denervation in the midbasal septal wall on iodine-123 MIBG SPECT imaging and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography. A retrospective review of the cardiac catheterization findings, however, revealed systolic compression of a septal perforator artery. The aborted sudden death of the patient was most likely associated with systolic compression of a septal branch or sympathetic denervation, which may have precipitated a ventricular arrhythmia in this patient.

### 11383979
### The effect of single oral doses of zopiclone on nocturnal melatonin secretion in healthy male volunteers.
### The effects of single oral doses of zopiclone and temazepam were investigated in eight healthy male volunteers using a single blind, placebo controlled cross over study. Doses of zopiclone were 7.5 and 15 mg while the dose of temazepam was 20 mg. Each dose was separated by at least a one-week washout period. For each subject the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) was determined on a screening night and the drugs were administered at the time of the DLMO. Melatonin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay from plasma samples collected throughout the night. Both temazepam and zopiclone tended to reduce the amount of melatonin secreted, as determined by the area under the plasma concentration time curve. The differences from placebo were not statistically significant (F 3.31 = 1.07, P > 0.1). Similarly a repeated measures analysis of variance on the plasma concentration-time curves did not show any statistically significant differences between drugs and placebo (F 3.28 = 1.15, P > 0.1). There was no evidence from this study of a phase shifting effect of the drugs used. The reasons for the lack of effect on melatonin may be due to the differences in potency of the interaction of these drugs with the GABA-benzodiazepine-chloride ion channel.

### 3808571
### Chemotherapeutic effects of 13 nitrosoureas on the LSA lymphoma ascites tumor of the C57BL mouse.
### The LSA lymphoma of the C57BL/ym mouse has been used to test 13 nitrosoureas for cure of advanced tumors and for induced tumor resistance (ITR) of surviving animals. Tumors were initiated by intraperitoneal inoculation of 10(6) LSA cells. Controls died in 8-9 days. Five-day old tumors were defined as advanced tumors, and treatment consisted of a single dose of a nitrosourea to groups of 10 male mice, 8-9 weeks old, for each compound. The nitrosoureas used were: BCNU (NSC-40992), CCNU (NSC-79037), MeCCNU (NSC-95441), chlorozotocin (CLZ) (NSC-178248), streptozotocin (STZN) (NSC-85998) CNU (NSC-47547), FCNU (NSC-87974), GANU (NSC-254174), ACNU (NSC-245382), PCNU (NSC-95466), cis-acid (NSC-153174), 153174), NSC-88104, and GCNU (NSC-114460). The major endpoint assessed was tumor cure and was grouped as follows: (1) high (greater than or equal to 80%), achieved with BCNU, MeCCNU, CCNU, CLZ, ACNU, FCNU, PCNU, and cis-acid; (2) medium (40- less than 80%), obtained with GANU, NSC-88104, and GCNU, and (3) low or nil (less than 40%), shown by CNU and STZN. The second endpoint was treatment-induced ITR. Cured mice, i.e., those surviving over 30 days after death of controls were challenged with 10(5) LSA live cells, and survivors from this challenge were challenged with 10(7) LSA cells 1 month later. Survivors from both inocula were considered highly immune (HI). High percentages of HI mice (greater than or equal to 80%) were obtained from mice cured with MeCCNU, CCNU, ACNU, FCNU, PCNU, and NSC-88104. STZN produced 0.0% cures; the other nitrosoureas showed 33.3-75% HI mice. Cure rates and ITR appeared to be agent- and structure-related. Cure alone did not lead to the resistant state.

### Feline immunodeficiency virus infection--causative agent of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in cats.
### An ideal animal model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in man should be caused by a genetically similar virus, it should cause as nearly identical clinical signs as possible, the pathogenesis of the resulting disease should be similar, and the model should be easily accessible to all researchers. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) meets all these criteria. FIV is particularly useful as an animal model for investigation of the pathogenesis of lentivirus infections like cofactor studies, as well as for vaccine strategies, and drug testing in vitro and in vivo.

### 8104097
### Intravenous benztropine and propranolol challenges in acute neuroleptic-induced akathisia.
### We challenged six patients suffering from acute neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA) with intravenous benztropine (2 mg), propranolol (1 mg), and placebo (saline) using a random, double-blind cross-over design to examine the effects of the drugs on the subjective, objective, and global manifestations of NIA. Benztropine produced a significant amelioration of NIA, more apparent in its subjective component. Propranolol failed to produce a significant improvement overall in any of the akathisia measures, with only one patient showing clinical improvement. The patients demonstrated considerable placebo effect and marked variation in their responses to the drugs.

### 11792887
### Prediction of successful application for disability benefits for people with arthritis using the Health Assessment Questionnaire.
### BACKGROUND: Many eligible people with arthritis do not receive disability benefits. Application forms are lengthy and complex, and doctors and nurses are often unsure which patients would qualify. AIM: To investigate how severe disability on the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) relates to successful application for disability benefits by people with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHOD: RA patients attending a hospital out-patient rheumatology clinic and patients with OA or RA in two general practices completed an HAQ and were asked about receipt of disability benefits. Those scoring 2 or more on the HAQ (severe disability) and not in receipt of benefits were offered professional help to complete applications for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or Attendance Allowance (AA). RESULTS: Eighty per cent of patients with an HAQ score of 2 or more were already in receipt of benefits. Seventy-nine per cent of the new applicants applied successfully, the average benefit being in excess of 2580 pounds per annum. CONCLUSION: This initial study suggests that people who score 2 or more on the HAQ should be encouraged to apply for disability benefits. A test of the generalizability of these findings and the success rate associated with lower HAQ scores should be undertaken.

### 15280645
### Cloning and sequence analysis of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene from the zygomycetes fungus Rhizomucor miehei.
### Rhizomucor miehei is important from a biotechnological aspect in consequence of its content of aspartic proteinase, which has high milk-clotting activity. A genomic library of R. miehei NRRL 5901 has been constructed in a phage (Lambda Fix II) vector. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) gene was isolated from this library by hybridization of the recombinant phage clones with a gpd-specific gene probe generated by polymerase chain reaction. The complete nucleotide sequence encodes a putative polypeptide chain of 336 amino acids interrupted by 5 introns. The predicted amino acid sequence of this gene shows a high degree of sequence similarity to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase proteins from yeast and filamentous fungi. The promoter region, containing a consensus TATA box, and 246-bp downstream from the putative stop codon were also determined. The possibility of using the gpd promoter in the construction of new transformation vectors is discussed.

### 7324871
### Heart muscle disease in familial hypokalaemic periodic paralysis.
### The case history, skeletal muscle and heart muscle biopsy findings from an affected member of a family suffering from hypokalaemic periodic paralysis associated with permanent muscular weakness are reported. The patient, a female aged 35 years, while treated with 750 mg and later 1000 mg of acetazolamide daily, developed typical exercise angina pectoris. The ECG during exercise showed ST-segment depression. A coronary angiography was performed because coronary artery disease was suspected. To exclude cardiac muscle disease a biopsy of the left ventricular wall was taken. The angiography was normal. Ultrastructural analysis of the biopsy specimen showed an unusual amount of intermyofibrillary glycogen resembling, although far less abundant, the increase of glycogen found in the skeletal muscle biopsy specimen obtained from the same patient. The possible implications of these findings are discussed with reference to the normal echocardiographic findings in the family.

### 14872549
### Simultaneous determination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in human plasma by capillary zone electrophoresis.
### A capillary electrophoretic method for the simultaneous determination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in plasma was developed. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim extracted from human plasma with ethyl acetate were analyzed at 20 kV and 25 degrees C using 15 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) as the electrolyte. The detection was by UV at 220 nm. The run time was 8.0 min and the limit of quantification was 10.00 microg/mL for sulfamethoxazole and 2.00 microg/mL for trimethoprim. The recovery was >99% for both compounds. This method enabled the detection of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in plasma of patients after oral ingestion of their combined formulation. The present simple and rapid method is applicable to drug monitoring in immunocompromised patients who are taking the combined formulation of these compounds for the treatment or prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

### Effects of intrarenal infusion of 17-octadecynoic acid on renal antihypertensive mechanisms in anesthetized rabbits.
### To characterize the role of cytochrome P450 metabolism of fatty acids in the renal response to increased renal perfusion pressure, we tested the effects of renal arterial infusion of 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA, 450 nmol/min) on renal and systemic hemodynamic, and renal excretory responses to step-wise increases in renal perfusion pressure (RPP) in anesthetized rabbits, using an extracorporeal circuit for renal autoperfusion. Inhibition of cytochrome P450-dependent fatty acid metabolism was estimated by comparing the metabolism of arachidonic acid in microsomes prepared from the kidneys of control and 17-ODYA-treated animals. Step-wise increases in RPP decreased mean arterial pressure, which previous studies have indicated is attributable to the release of a depressor hormone from the renal medulla. Elevations in RPP also increased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, and the absolute and fractional excretions of urine and sodium. Intrarenal infusion of 17-ODYA reduced the metabolism of arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid by 41%, but it did not significantly influence the responses to increased renal perfusion pressure. We conclude that either the responses elicited by increased renal perfusion pressure in anesthetized rabbits do not depend on cytochrome P450-dependent fatty acid metabolism, or that cytochrome P450 activity must be inhibited by more than was achieved in the present study (41%), before functional effects on the response to increased renal perfusion pressure are observed.

### 16355830
### Influence of blanching treatments on Salmonella during home-type dehydration and storage of potato slices.
### Recommended drying treatments may not enhance destruction of pathogens that could be present on home-dried foods. In this study, the effects of traditional and modified treatments on Salmonella were evaluated during preparation, home-type dehydration (60 degrees C for 6 h), and storage of potato slices. Potato slices inoculated with five strains of Salmonella (8.4 log CFU/ g) were left untreated or were treated by steam blanching (88 degrees C for 10 min), water blanching (88 degrees C for 4 min), 0.105% citric acid blanching (88 degrees C for 4 min), or 0.210% citric acid blanching (88 degrees C for 4 min). Slices were then dried (6 h for 60 degrees C) and aerobically stored for up to 30 days at 25 +/- 3 degrees C. Cells were enumerated on tryptic soy agar with 0.1% pyruvate (TSAP) and on xylose lysine deoxycholate agar. Salmonella populations were reduced by 4.5 to 4.8 CFU/g and by >5.4 log CFU/g immediately following steam and water blanching, respectively. Populations were below the detection limit (0.80 log CFU/g) immediately following acid blanching, except for samples blanched in 0.105% citric acid and recovered on TSAP. After dehydration (6 h for 60 degrees C), Salmonella reductions on blanched potato slices (5.3 to 5.6 log CFU/g) were significantly greater (P < 0.05) than those on untreated samples (1.9 to 2.7 log CFU/g). Populations on all samples continued to decrease throughout 30 days of storage but still were 3.1 to 3.9 log CFU/g on untreated samples. In comparison, bacterial populations on blanched samples were undetectable by direct plating following 30 days of storage (regardless of blanching method). Blanching treatments used in this study improved the effectiveness of drying for inactivating Salmonella inoculated onto potato slices and, therefore, may enhance the safety of the product.

### 9732288
### Gamma-sarcoglycan deficiency leads to muscle membrane defects and apoptosis independent of dystrophin.
### gamma-Sarcoglycan is a transmembrane, dystrophin-associated protein expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The murine gamma-sarcoglycan gene was disrupted using homologous recombination. Mice lacking gamma-sarcoglycan showed pronounced dystrophic muscle changes in early life. By 20 wk of age, these mice developed cardiomyopathy and died prematurely. The loss of gamma-sarcoglycan produced secondary reduction of beta- and delta-sarcoglycan with partial retention of alpha- and epsilon-sarcoglycan, suggesting that beta-, gamma-, and delta-sarcoglycan function as a unit. Importantly, mice lacking gamma-sarco- glycan showed normal dystrophin content and local- ization, demonstrating that myofiber degeneration occurred independently of dystrophin alteration. Furthermore, beta-dystroglycan and laminin were left intact, implying that the dystrophin-dystroglycan-laminin mechanical link was unaffected by sarcoglycan deficiency. Apoptotic myonuclei were abundant in skeletal muscle lacking gamma-sarcoglycan, suggesting that programmed cell death contributes to myofiber degeneration. Vital staining with Evans blue dye revealed that muscle lacking gamma-sarcoglycan developed membrane disruptions like those seen in dystrophin-deficient muscle. Our data demonstrate that sarcoglycan loss was sufficient, and that dystrophin loss was not necessary to cause membrane defects and apoptosis. As a common molecular feature in a variety of muscular dystrophies, sarcoglycan loss is a likely mediator of pathology.

### Characterization of LY231617 protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
### The compound LY231617 [2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-[[(1-ethyl)amino]methyl]phenol hydrochloride] has been reported to afford significant neuroprotection against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced toxicity in vitro and global ischemia in vivo. We now report on further mechanistic studies of H2O2 toxicity and protection by LY231617. Brief exposure to H2O2 (15 min) elicited an oxidative insult comparable with that generated by overnight treatment. H2O2-mediated cellular degeneration was characterized using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, changes in total glutathione, and a new marker of oxidative stress, 8-epiprostaglandin F2alpha (8-isoprostane). LY231617 attenuated H2O2-mediated degeneration under a variety of exposure conditions, including a more clinically relevant posttreatment paradigm. Levels of 8-isoprostane paralleled LDH release under various treatment paradigms of 100 microM H2O2 +/- 5 microM drug. In contrast, despite affording significant protection, LY231617 had modest to no effects on cellular levels of glutathione. Taken together, these results are consistent with a membrane site of action for LY231617 and suggest that the compound affords cytoprotection via its antioxidant properties.

### 16011942
### Scoring standardized patient examinations: lessons learned from the development and administration of the ECFMG Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA).
### Throughout the 40 year history of standardized patient assessments and OSCEs, there have been numerous advancements, including many that involve scoring the simulated clinical encounters. While there is no clear agreement on how examinees' performance should be documented or scored in an encounter, there is a consensus that several well-chosen SP encounters are required to produce reliable examinee scores. There also continues to be some debate as to who should do the scoring on an SP-based assessment. While logistics and cost will certainly play a role, it is probably best to use the person who is most familiar with the domain being assessed. In some instances this will be the SP; in others, an outside observer or content expert. Finally, with the growing use of OSCEs for summative purposes (e.g. certification, licensure), special attention must be paid to fairness issues. Since the same test form cannot be used day after day, examinee scores must be 'equated', taking into account the psychometric properties of scores from individual cases and individual SPs. To date, the CSA has been one of the highest-volume, high-stakes, standardized patient assessments to be developed and successfully administered. In 2003 alone, over 11 500 IMGs were tested. The early conceptual framework for this assessment was synthesized from the research endeavours of several notable individuals, including, amongst many others, Harden et al. 1975, Swanson & Stillman, 1990, Newble & Swanson, 1988, Vu et al. 1992 and Colliver, 1995. The early prototype administrations of the CSA, including many operational research studies, were supported and guided by Dr Friedman Ben-David, Friedman et al. 1991, 1993, Stillman et al. 1992, and Sutnick et al. 1993, 1995.

### Opiate receptor identification in vitro and in vivo.
### Using tritiated opiates with a high specific radioactivity, a high affinity binding to brain homogenates has been observed in vitro. Strong evidence was given that this type of binding is due to the interaction of labelled opiates with their specific receptors in the brain, since the ability of a wide variety of opiates to inhibit this binding corresponds very well with the potency of the drugs to produce their pharmacological effects in vivo. We have found that the simultaneous injection of labelled opiates into animals together with high doses of nonradioactive opiates decreases the brain concentration of the labelled drug. This displacement from brain satisfies criteria similar to those used for the identification of the opiate receptor in vitro. Furthermore, opiates produce their pharmacological effects in the same dose range in which they are able to displace a radiolabelled opiate from the brain. This strongly suggests that the receptor occupation by opiates can be identified by concentration changes in the brain of living animals.

### 11255162
### Evolution of a recombinant (gucoamylase-producing) strain of Fusarium venenatum A3/5 in chemostat culture.
### Fusarium venenatum JeRS 325 is a transformant of strain A3/5 which produces Aspergillus niger glucoamylase (GAM) under the control of a Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease promoter. The evolution of JeRS 325 was studied in glucose-limited chemostat cultures grown on NaNO3 or (NH4)2SO4 as the nitrogen source. Thirteen mutants which were more highly branched and four mutants which were more sparsely branched than the parental strain were isolated from the NaNO3 chemostat. The highly branched mutants detected in this chemostat did not displace the sparsely branched population. The mutants isolated from the NaNO3 chemostat complemented representative strains previously isolated from glucose-limited chemostat cultures of F. venenatum A3/5 grown on (NH4)2SO4, but showed little complementation between themselves. By contrast, a highly branched mutant isolated from the (NH4)2SO4 chemostat culture displaced the sparsely branched mycelial population. None of the mutants isolated from the NaNO3 or (NH4)2SO4 chemostats produced as much GAM as JeRS 325. Southern blot analysis showed that all except one mutant had lost copies of both the glucoamylase and the acetamidase (the selectable marker) genes. However, specific GAM production was not necessarily correlated with the extent of glaA gene loss observed. Further, 10 of the mutants had lost the ability to grow on acetamide as the sole nitrogen source, although they retained copies of the amdS gene. In competition studies, mutants which could not utilize acetamide displaced mutants which could. The presence of foreign DNA in JeRS 325 resulted in a reduced specific growth rate (compared to A3/5), but the presence of the foreign DNA did not prevent the evolution of the strain or the isolation of mutants which had improved growth rates.

### 8855552
### Potential antifolate resistance determinants and genotypic variation in the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase gene from human and bovine isolates of Cryptosporidium parvum.
### We have determined the nucleic acid sequences of a gene encoding the bifunctional enzyme dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) from bovine and human AIDS isolates of Cryptosporidium parvum. THe DHFR-TS gene was isolated from genomic DNA libraries by hybridization with a probe amplified from C. parvum genomic DNA using generic TS primers in the polymerase chain reaction. Genomic Southern and electrophoretic karyotype analyses reveal C. parvum DHFR-TS is a single-copy gene on a 1200-kb chromosome. The DHFR-TS nucleic acid sequence contains no introns and the single 1563-bp open reading frame encodes a 179 residue N-terminal DHFR domain connected by a 55 amino acid junction peptide to a 287 residue C-terminal TS domain. The sequences of the DHFR-TS gene from the bovine and human C. parvum isolates differ at two positions in the 5'-flanking sequence and at 38 positions in the encoding sequence. These DNA sequence polymorphisms will provide a powerful probe to examine the genotypic diversity and genetic population structure of C. parvum. The two sequences encode identical TS domains which share all except one of the phylogenetically conserved amino acid residues identified among reported TS sequences. The predicted DHFR domain sequences contain nine amino acid differences; these polymorphisms all map to non-active site, surface locations in known DHFR structures. The C. parvum DHFR active site contains novel residues at several positions analogous to those at which point mutations have been shown to produce antifolate resistance in other DHFRs. Thus C. parvum DHFR may be intrinsically resistant ti inhibition by some antifolate DHFR inhibitors which may explain why cryptosporidiosis is refractory to treatment with the clinically common antibacterial and antiprotozoal antifolates.

### 6299365
### Aluminum interaction with calmodulin. Evidence for altered structure and function from optical and enzymatic studies.
### The interaction of aluminum ions with bovine brain calmodulin has been examined by fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroic spectrophotometry and equilibrium dialysis, and by the calmodulin-dependent activation of 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. These experiments show that aluminum binds stoichiometrically and cooperatively to calmodulin. Binding of aluminum at a molar ratio of 2:1 to calmodulin suffices to induce a major structural change. Estimates from spectroscopic data indicate that the binding affinity for the first mol of aluminum bound to the protein is about one order of magnitude stronger than that of calcium to its comparable site. These estimates agree with a dissociation constant of 0.4 microM derived from equilibrium dialysis experiments. Interaction of aluminum with calmodulin induces a helix-coil transition and enhances the hydrophobic surface area much more than calcium does. A molar ratio of 4:1 for [aluminum]/[calmodulin] is sufficient to block completely the activity of the calcium-calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase. Highly hydrated aluminum ions apparently promote solvent-rich, disordered polypeptide regions in calmodulin which, in turn, profoundly influence the protein's flexibility.

### The effect of treatment with Corynebacterium parvum on the development and growth of experimental hematogenic metastases of schwannoma in the rat.
### Single i.v. administration of Corynebacterium parvum 5 days before i.v. injection of 10(6) tissue cultured syngeneic schwannoma cells in Lewis rats resulted in extension of survival time (P less than 0.05). There was a significant decrease in metastatic tumor incidence for lung, heart, and kidney and decreased lung tumor growth with approximately 50% of the lung tumor burden of untreated controls (P less than 0.05). Rats treated similarly with C. parvum 10 days after tumor cell injection showed no enhanced survival; to the contrary, their survival was shortened. Moreover, tumor incidence in the post-treated group was not significantly different from the control but significantly increased in comparison to the pretreated group. Enhanced lung tumor growth resulted in a final tumor burden about twice that of untreated controls (P less than 0.05).

### Vp1 affects intracellular localization of Vp3 polypeptide during simian virus 40 infection.
### In order to understand the functions of simian virus 40 genes, permissive cells (TC7) were infected with mutants temperature sensitive in the complementation groups A, B, C, BC, and D at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. Cells were examined for the localization of viral polypeptide antigens by immunofluorescent staining with monospecific antibodies. The results are as follows: (i) The appearance of Vp1 antigen in cells infected by tsB, C, or BC mutants was not affected appreciably by the mutations. (ii) The appearance of Vp3 antigen was affected by the mutations in B, C, or BC. Vp3 antigen is confined to the nuclei in cells infected by wild-type virus. With mutant virus infection, Vp3 antigen is found in the cytoplasm, perinuclear region, and nucleoli. (iii) The tsD mutants and the tsA mutants did not express either Vp1 or Vp3 antigens at the nonpermissive temperature. (iv) Nucleoli seem to play an essential role in the biosynthesis and assembly of viral polypeptides. Thus, mutations in any one of complementation groups B, C, or BC, which are within the structural gene for Vp1, cause an alteration of intracellular distribution of another late gene product, Vp3. These results suggest that the amino acid sequences of Vp1 polypeptide play a role(s) in the transport of viral antigens across internal membranes or in virus assembly processes or in both.

### 7411352
### The technique of myotomy in esophageal reconstruction: an experimental study.
### Circular myotomy has been shown to be a useful technique for approximating widely separated segments in esophageal atresia. We tested variations of this technique experimentally in dogs and found a significantly greater decrease in tension after double, spiral, and stepladder myotomies. Complications as measured by mortality and morbidity (leaks, strictures, and weight loss) were not found to differ statistically in the various groups, although there is a suggestion that the spiral myotomy group may have less postoperative problems.

### 7119162
### A study of the extrinsic innervation of the guinea pig pylorus with the horseradish peroxidase tracing technique.
### The extrinsic innervation of the guinea pig pylorus was studied by the use of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracing technique. Forty-eight hours after injection of HRP into the pyloric sphincter labeled neurons of varying sizes were found throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the dorsal motor nuclei of the vagus. No HRP positive cells were seen in the medial solitary nuclei or the ambiguous nuclei. Many HRP-positive cells were observed in the celiac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex. Occasional cells in the superior cervical and stellate ganglia were also labeled. When the vagal ganglia were analyzed many enzyme-containing cells were found in the nodose ganglia and some cells in the jugular ganglia. Furthermore, about 15-20% of the labeled afferent neurons were located in dorsal root ganglia on both sides, with the majority of cells at the T5--T10 levels. The results are discussed in relation to recent transmitter histochemical findings as well as possible functional roles of the neurons.

### The calcium, copper and zinc content of some annelid extracellular haemoglobins.
### The extracellular haemoglobins of Lumbricus and Tylorrhynchus contain 50 and 61 tightly bound calcium atoms per molecule, respectively. In addition, they contain one to four tightly bound copper and zinc atoms. Although the role of the latter is unknown, that of calcium is probably structural, assisting in the maintenance of the native hexagonal bilayer structure.

### 3843746
### Chromosome studies in 3665 consecutive newborn children.
### Results of chromosomal studies done on 3665 newborn children from central Poland have been described. As against a global incidence of 1:1022 for trisomy G and 1:1308 for the balanced translocation D/D in infants, the respective figures for the Polish infants were, 1:610 and 1:1221. Likewise, against the global incidence of 1:823 for the karyotype 47, XXY and of 1:1072 for the karyotype 47, XYY in infants, the respective incidence in the Polish infants was 1:626 and 1:939. The study has demonstrated also that the frequency of occurrence of the different widths of the C-bands had a distribution close to normal. The authors have noted that the children with chromosomal abnormalities were more frequently not as well developed at birth as were children with normal karyotypes.

### 14988897
### Percutaneous coronary intervention in a patient with immune thrombocytopenia purpura.
### The appropriate regimen of platelet inhibitors that should be used in patients with immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP; formerly called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) who are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention is unclear. We report the case of a patient with ITP who underwent two separate coronary interventions. The first involved the use of aspirin and a cutting balloon to treat obstructive disease of the left circumflex. When the patient presented with restenosis, he received eptifibatide, clopidogrel, and an intracoronary stent. He is currently 16 months removed from his second procedure and remains physically active without any anginal symptoms. Percutaneous revascularization in patients with ITP remains a challenge and this therapeutic approach, while ultimately successful in the patient, requires further validation.

### 4038429
### Soy protein products and heme iron absorption in humans.
### Dual radioiron tags were used to measure both heme and nonheme iron absorption simultaneously from meat-containing meals in 76 healthy male volunteers. Partial substitution of beef with soy flour reduced the availability of nonheme iron but improved the percentage absorption of heme iron significantly (27 to 59% rise). In contradistinction three other powerful inhibitors of nonheme iron absorption, bran, tea, and desferrioxamine, had no appreciable effect on heme. Ascorbic acid (100 mg and 1000 mg in separate experiments) improved nonheme iron uptake markedly but also failed to alter the assimilation of heme. These studies demonstrate that the deleterious effects on iron nutrition of substituting soy protein for beef are partially offset by improved availability of the remaining heme iron as well as by an increase in the nonheme iron content of the meal.

### Amino acid analogs. III: New syntheses of monomethyl- and monophenylglutamic acids.
### Glutamic acid analogs containing 3- and 4-methyl and 2-, 3-, and 4-phenyl substituents were prepared. The 3- and 4-methyl- and 3- and 4-phenylglutamic acids did not inhibit Plasmodium berghei and were nontoxic to the host (mice) at 640 mg/kg. The five analogs in addition to 2-methlglutamic acid were inactive against Lactobacillus casei at 1000 mug/ml in a defined medium: against Escherichia coli, only 2-methylglutamic acid caused 27% inhibition at 10,000 mug/ml. All six analogs failed to inhibit Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Trichoderma viride, and Myrothecium verrucaria in a defined medium below 10,000 mug/ml.

### 391265
### p-(Bromoacetamido)phenyl uridyl pyrophosphate: an active-site-directed irreversible inhibitor for uridine diphosphate galactose 4-epimerase.
### The synthesis of p-(bromoacetamido)phenyl uridyl pyrophosphate (BUP) is described. This compound is an active-site-directed irreversible inhibitor of Escherichia coli UDP-galactose 4-epimerase. The inactivation follows pseudo-first-order kinetics at pH 8.5 in nonnucleophilic buffers, and a saturation effect is seen in the pseudo-first-order rate constant as the concentration of BUP is increased. The half-saturation parameter for BUP in the inactivation is 0.21 +/- 0.02 mM, which compares favorably with the inhibition constant of 0.3 +/- 0.05 mM for BUP acting as a competitive reversible inhibitor of the enzyme. The inactivation rate is slow, however, with a minimum half-time of 12 h at pH 8.5 and 27 degrees C. Both specific alkylation and nonspecific alkylation by BUP occur, but nonspecific alkylation is faster than the inactivation and the rate of inactivation correlates well with the rate of covalent incorporation of one molecule of [14C]BUP at the active site.

### [Detection of verotoxin-producing E. coli in field isolates from domestic and agricultural animals in Sachsen-Anhalt]
### A report is given on the detection of verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) strains from field isolates of healthy or ill cattle (n = 141), pigs (n = 306), sheep (n = 15), cats (n = 29) and dogs (n = 25) in the region of the new federal land Sachsen-Anhalt. 5% of the strains isolated from cattle, 32% from pigs, 20% from sheep, 4% from dogs and 0% from cats have shown VTEC. The E. coli-strains were checked for the presence of other factors of virulence, too. A good correlation (82%) was found between the colonization factor F107 and SLT 2/2v-containing strains from pigs in the region of Sachsen-Anhalt, too. Enterohemolysin was not found in SLT 2/2v-positive strains. 91% of the VTEC, isolated from pigs, produced alpha-Hemolysin. The correlation of SLT-containing strains and the production of enterohemolysin was confirmed for ruminants, only. Plasmidprofilings of VTEC from pigs showed mainly a 60 MDa or a 68 MDa plasmid or both, too. The occurrence of heat labile (LT) and in some cases of heat stable (ST) toxin was also checked, to differentiate the VTEC-strains from the enterotoxigenic E. coli strains (ETEC). These investigations showed, that VTEC produce SLT almost without exception. Correlations and conclusions on the pathogenicity for humans are discussed.

### 6137304
### Current concepts of the endocrine characteristics of normal menstrual function: the key to diagnosis and management of menstrual disorders.
### Obviously, the endocrine mechanisms involved in producing the normal, cyclic pattern of menstrual bleeding are exceedingly complex. A review of even our current, far from complete, knowledge of the regulation of follicular growth, cyclic selection of a single dominant follicle, ovulation, and the neuroendocrine control of all three mechanisms only serves to emphasize the myriad of endogenous and exogenous factors that may adversely affect such a delicate balance and be manifest in menstrual disturbance. Indeed, one may wonder that the menstrual cycle is cyclic and predictable at all. Nevertheless, the efficiency with which the system normally operates is striking. Its very complexity often makes disorders of menstrual function a not infrequent symptom of disease outside the reproductive tract, a fact that should stress the need for prompt and thorough evaluation.

### The emergence of antibiotic resistance by mutation.
### The emergence of mutations in nucleic acids is one of the major factors underlying evolution, providing the working material for natural selection. Most bacteria are haploid for the vast majority of their genes and, coupled with typically short generation times, this allows mutations to emerge and accumulate rapidly, and to effect significant phenotypic changes in what is perceived to be real-time. Not least among these phenotypic changes are those associated with antibiotic resistance. Mechanisms of horizontal gene spread among bacterial strains or species are often considered to be the main mediators of antibiotic resistance. However, mutational resistance has been invaluable in studies of bacterial genetics, and also has primary clinical importance in certain bacterial species, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori, or when considering resistance to particular antibiotics, especially to synthetic agents such as fluoroquinolones and oxazolidinones. In addition, mutation is essential for the continued evolution of acquired resistance genes and has, e.g., given rise to over 100 variants of the TEM family of beta-lactamases. Hypermutator strains of bacteria, which have mutations in genes affecting DNA repair and replication fidelity, have elevated mutation rates. Mutational resistance emerges de novo more readily in these hypermutable strains, and they also provide a suitable host background for the evolution of acquired resistance genes in vitro. In the clinical setting, hypermutator strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, but a more general role for hypermutators in the emergence of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in a wider variety of bacterial pathogens has not yet been proven.

### 9475170
### Two-step mechanism of inhibition of cathepsin B by cystatin C due to displacement of the proteinase occluding loop.
### Stopped-flow kinetics showed that the inhibition of the lysosomal cysteine proteinase, cathepsin B, by its endogenous inhibitor, cystatin C, occurs by a two-step mechanism, in which an initial, weak interaction is followed by a conformational change. The initial interaction most likely involves binding of the N-terminal region of the inhibitor to the proteinase. Considerable evidence indicates that the subsequent conformational change is due to the inhibitor displacing the occluding loop of the proteinase that partially obscures the active site. The presence of this loop, which allows the enzyme to function as an exopeptidase, thus complicates the inhibition mechanism, rendering cathepsin B much less susceptible than other cysteine proteinases to inhibition by cystatins.

### 725512
### Intestinal bypass. Experimental study on the influence of the excluded intestinal segment.
### Five groups of operated rats with 10% of the small intestine in continuity were studied. In one group the animals were subjected to 90% resection of the small intestine, and in the other groups a 90% jejuno-ileal bypass was performed. In two of the latter groups different lengths of the excluded intestinal segment was resected. The bypassed segment was anastomosed to the colon in three of the groups and to the skin as an ileostomy in one group. There were no differences in haemoglobin concentration, liver function parameters or fat absorption between the five groups, but measurements of body weight seem to indicate that the bypassed intestinal segment exerts a general harmful effect on the rats. This effect is more pronounced when the excluded segment is long, and the effect seems to be the same whether it is connected to the colon or to the skin. The mechanism for this effect is not fully ascertained.

### 9678692
### Reactive hemophagocytosis in systemic lupus erythematosus.
### A patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) developed reactive hemophagocytosis. This case did not show any underlying diseases such as infection or malignancy other than SLE itself. The mechanisms inducing hemophagocytosis in SLE seem to be heterogeneous and remain to be elucidated. Although an immune complex-mediated mechanism in cases with acute lupus hemophagocytic syndrome has been proposed, we suggest the possible involvement of IL-1beta as the pathogenesis of our case.

### 7161266
### Purification and properties of a novel lipase from Staphylococcus aureus 226.
### A novel lipase of Staphylococcus aureus 226 was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by successive chromatographies on hydroxylapatite, Sephadex G-200 and G-150. This method gave 385-fold purification of the enzyme from the culture medium in a yield of 25%. The purified enzyme appeared homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The purified lipase hydrolyzed all the triacylglycerols and 1-monoacylglycerols tested, showing maximal activity with trilaurin and 1-monoolein. Furthermore, 2-monoolein was also found to be one of the best substrates for the lipase. The optimum temperature of the purified enzyme was 60 degrees C with triolein. The molecular weight of the enzyme was reduced in the presence of sodium deoxycholate and was estimated as 34,000 by gel filtration and its isoelectric point as 9.7. Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions enhanced the enzymatic reaction, whereas Mn2+ ions were inhibitory. p-Chloromercuribenzoate, iodoacetamide, and N-ethylmaleimide did not inhibit the enzyme.

### 11576996
### Role of the high mobility group A proteins in human lipomas.
### The HMGA family is comprised of four proteins: HMGA1a, HMGA1b, HMGA1c and HMGA2. The first three proteins are products of the same gene, HMGA1, generated through an alternative splicing mechanism. The HMGA proteins are involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and HMGA DNA-binding sites have been identified in functional regions of many gene promoters. Rearrangements of the HMGA2 gene have been frequently detected in human benign tumors of mesenchymal origin including lipomas. 12q13-15 chromosomal translocations involving the HMGA2 gene locus, account for these rearrangements. The HMGA proteins have three AT-hook domains and an acidic C-terminal tail. The HMGA2 modifications consist in the loss of the C-terminal tail and fusion with ectopic sequences. A pivotal role of the HMGA2 rearrangements in the process of lipomagenesis is suggested by experiments showing that transgenic mice carrying a truncated HMGA2 gene showed a giant phenotype together with abdominal/pelvic lipomatosis. As HMGA2 null mice showed a great reduction in fat tissue, a positive role of the HMGA2 gene in adipocytic cell proliferation is proposed. More recently, similar alterations of the HMGA1 gene have been described. As the block of the HMGA1 protein synthesis induces an increase in growth rate of the pre-adipocytic cell line 3T3-L1, we suggest a negative role of the HMGA1 proteins in adipocytic cell growth and, therefore, we propose that adipocytic cell growth derives from the balance of the HMGA1 and HMGA2 protein functions.

### 6254332
### Dual photon absorptiometry in lumbar vertebrae. Evaluation of the baseline error.
### In connection with determination of the bone mineral content in the third lumbar vertebra by dual photon absorptiometry, the fat in the adipose capsules of the kidneys is assumed to cause erroneous positioning of the baseline, leading to overestimation of the bone mineral content. The bone mineral content in L3 was measured in situ (BMC1) and vitro (BMC2) in 14 cadavers. The difference between BMC1 and BMC2 was significantly greater than zero, the median value being 0.32 g/cm at the confidence level of 94.4 per cent. It is concluded that at correlation between bone mineral content and compressive strength in vitro, the in vivo strength is overestimated by about 250 N.

### 8256176
### Emergency room: individuals, families and groups in trauma.
### Each year in Israel hundreds of people lose their lives in road accidents; many more are injured (Field Staff, 1986). The effect on families, on hospital staff, and even on whole communities can be debilitating. Recognizing the grave impact of trauma and its aftermath, the Haemak Medical Center, Afula, established an emergency/trauma program in 1986. The program was developed by the Department of Social Work Services, with the cooperation of the emergency room (ER) team. Based on meetings with and preparation of the ER team (physicians, nurses, and social work staff), the department developed a protocol for integrating social workers and psychosocial concepts into the emergency/trauma situation.

### 17325212
### Marked hyperbilirubinemia associated with the heme oxygenase-1 gene promoter microsatellite polymorphism in a boy with autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
### Mild hyperbilirubinemia is a clinical feature of hemolysis. Here we describe a boy with marked elevation of serum bilirubin values (maximum: 70 mg/dL) during an acute episode of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which returned to within the reference range after clinical improvement. The boy was a homozygous carrier of short alleles of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene GT dinucleotide-repeat promoter polymorphism, which is associated with increased activity and inducibility of the heme-degrading enzyme HO-1, which catalyzes the production of bilirubin. In addition, heterozygosity of the uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyl-transferase 1A1 promoter polymorphism that is linked with Gilbert syndrome was found in this patient. Because bilirubin production plays a critical role during the neonatal period, the HO-1 promoter polymorphism may be an important genetic factor for the clinical outcome of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

### 10566802
### Serological assays as alternatives to the Ph Eur challenge test for batch release of tetanus vaccines for human use.
### According to the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph Eur) monograph on Tetanus Vaccine (adsorbed) (1997: 0452), assessment of potency is based on a challenge test in guinea pigs or mice. The end-point is taken as paralysis or death. The test requires a large number of animals and causes severe distress. The aim of the present study was to refine the test, and reduce the number of animals needed, for batch release purposes. Serological assays having the potential of being internationally accepted, have been compared with Ph Eur assays. The study included five tetanus vaccines of various combinations and produced by different manufacturers. The results indicated an excellent correlation between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the challenge test (about 93% predictive value), as well as between the toxin binding inhibition (ToBI) test and the challenge test (about 95% predictive value) and between ELISA and the ToBI test (r = 0.92). Antitoxin concentrations determined by ELISA and ToBI were generally in the same range. An overall good correlation was also seen for serum pools of the guinea pigs injected with equal vaccine doses, between toxin neutralisation test in mice (TNT) and ELISA (r = 0.93) as well as between TNT and ToBI (r = 0.97). The ultimate goal of this project was to determine whether serological assays can be used for testing combined vaccines, particularly for tetanus and diphtheria components, using sera from the same animals.

### Analysis of cardiac chronotropic responses to some autonomic blocking agents in conscious trained dogs.
### The changes of heart rate in response to i.v. administration of methylatropine (0.5 mg/kg) and/or propranolol (2 mg/Kg) or practolol (2.5 mg/Kg) were studied in conscious trained dogs. Cholinergic blockade alone or combined blockade of sympathetic and parasympathetic effector systems resulted in cardiac acceleration. Conversely, beta-adrenoceptor antagonism with either propranolol or practolol reduced heart rate. The data were analysed by means of a new method, whereby the heart (HRN) of the dog is considered to be the product of the intrinsic heart rate (HR0) and 3 further factors: HRN-HR0 times S times V times W (Multiplicative model). 2 of these factors represent the tonic sympathetic (S) and parasympathetic (V) influences, whereas the third (W) represents the sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction. This type of analysis reveals that W was approximately 1, i.e., the sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction did not play any significant role in determining the heart rate of conscious resting dogs (HRN = HRO-S-V-W = HRO-S-V). The change of heart rate due to the action of parasympathetic system (-53% of the intrinsic heart rate) was more important than the change caused by the action of the sympathetic system (26% of the intrinsic heart rate).

### A critique of emerging European legislation in the pharmaceutical industry: a clinical trials analysis.
### The objective of this paper is to critique emerging legislation in the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on the clinical trials sector. Possible changes are identified and discussed inrelation to their impact on phase I clinical trials conducted in the UK. It is concluded that smaller contract research organisations, which have benefited in the past from European Union legislative variation, may have resource problems in trying to cope with the changing business environment created through legislative harmonization. These SMEs must use this opportunity to seek clinical trials research partnerships in a new harmonized EU market.

### 6698321
### Roentgenographic cranial-base and calvarial measurements of north Indian children from birth to two years of age.
### In order to establish norms for dimensions of the skull in North Indian children, lateral skull films of 166 apparently healthy, normocephalic children between birth and two years of age were studied. Using bony reference points, measurements were made of cranial-base length and calvarial height. It appears that there is definite proportionality between growth of ventral and posterior cranial-base, calvarium and ventral base, and anterior and posterior calvarium, at all ages and for both sexes. Deviation in these proportions may suggest abnormality in a corresponding area of the cranium.

### 14769943
### Identification of a prostate cancer susceptibility locus on chromosome 7q11-21 in Jewish families.
### Results from over a dozen prostate cancer susceptibility genome-wide scans, encompassing some 1,500 hereditary prostate cancer families, indicate that prostate cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease with multiple loci contributing to overall susceptibility. In an attempt to reduce locus heterogeneity, we performed a genomewide linkage scan for prostate cancer susceptibility genes with 36 Jewish families, which represent a stratification of hereditary prostate cancer families with potentially increased locus homogeneity. The 36 Jewish families represent a combined dataset of 17 Jewish families from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center-based Prostate Cancer Genetic Research Study dataset and 19 Ashkenazi Jewish families collected at Johns Hopkins University. All available family members, including 94 affected men, were genotyped at markers distributed across the genome with an average interval of <10 centimorgans. Nonparametric multipoint linkage analyses were the primary approach, although parametric analyses were performed as well. Our strongest signal was a significant linkage peak at 7q11-21, with a nonparametric linkage (NPL) score of 3.01 (P = 0.0013). Simulations indicated that this corresponds to a genomewide empirical P = 0.006. All other regions had NPL P values >/=0.02. After genotyping additional markers within the 7q11-21 peak, the NPL score increased to 3.35 (P = 0.0004) at D7S634 with an allele-sharing logarithm of odds of 3.12 (P = 0.00007). These studies highlight the utility of analyzing defined sets of families with a common origin for reducing locus heterogeneity problems associated with studying complex traits.

### 2882399
### Binaltorphimine and nor-binaltorphimine, potent and selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonists.
### The opioid antagonist activities of two bivalent ligands, BNI and nor-BNI, have been evaluated in smooth muscle preparations and in mice. Both ligands are highly potent and selective as kappa opioid receptor antagonists, with relatively feeble blocking activity at mu and delta opioid receptors. BNI and nor-BNI represent the first highly selective kappa opioid receptor antagonists and should be of great utility as molecular probes for identifying the interaction of agonist ligands with kappa opioid receptors in vitro and in vivo.

### 6264084
### An enriched preparation of basal-lateral plasma membranes from gastric glandular cells.
### A procedure is described for the preparation of a membrane fraction enriched in basal-lateral plasma membranes from gastric mucosa. Gastric glands isolated from rabbit were employed as starting material, greatly reducing contamination from non-glandular cell types. The distribution of cellular components during the fractionation procedure was monitored with specific marker enzymes. (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, ouabain-sensitive K+-stimulated p-nitrophenyl-phosphatase and histamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase were used as markers for basal-lateral membranes. These three markers were similarly distributed during both differential and equilibrium density gradient centrifugation. The enriched membrane fraction contained more than 30% of the total initial activities of the three basal-lateral membrane markers which were purified better than 11-fold with respect to protein. (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity was resolved from the activities of acid phosphatase, pepsin, Mg2+-ATPase, cytochrome c oxidase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, glucose-6-phosphatase, (K+ + H+)-ATPase, DNA and RNA.

### 4057450
### Subclavian steal despite ipsilateral vertebral occlusion.
### In the classic subclavian steal syndrome, vertebrobasilar insufficiency is caused by reverse flow in the vertebral artery ipsilateral to a subclavian stenosis or occlusion. We present two patients with vertebrobasilar insufficiency and ipsilateral vertebral and subclavian occlusive disease. The postulated mechanism of vertebrobasilar insufficiency is reverse flow in collateral neck vessels. In both patients, symptoms were relieved by carotid subclavian bypass. Thus, vertebral occlusion ipsilateral to a subclavian stenosis does not preclude subclavian steal syndrome.

### 16200349
### Characterization of HPV-16 E6 DNA vaccines employing intracellular targeting and intercellular spreading strategies.
### Human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 are consistently expressed and are responsible for the malignant transformation of HPV-associated lesions. Thus, E6 and E7 represent ideal targets for therapeutic HPV vaccine development. We have previously used the gene gun approach to test several intracellular targeting and intercellular spreading strategies targeting HPV-16 E7. These strategies include the use of the sorting signal of lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP-1), Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), calreticulin (CRT) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) VP22 proteins. All of these strategies have been shown to be capable of enhancing E7-DNA vaccine potency. In the current study, we have characterized DNA vaccines employing these intracellular targeting or intercellular spreading strategies targeting HPV-16 E6 for their ability to generate E6-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and antitumor effects against an E6-expressing tumor cell line, TC-1, in C57BL/6 mice. We found that all the intracellular targeting strategies (CRT, LAMP-1, HSP70) as well as the intercellular spreading strategy (VP22) were able to enhance E6 DNA vaccine potency, although the orientation of HSP70 linked to E6 antigen in the E6 DNA vaccine appears to be important for the HSP70 strategy to work. The enhanced E6-specific CD8+ T cell immune response in vaccinated mice also translated into potent antitumor effects against TC-1 tumor cells. Our data indicate that all of the intracellular targeting and intercellular spreading strategies that have been shown to enhance E7 DNA vaccine potency were also able to enhance E6 DNA vaccine potency.

### 1123914
### Conditions influencing platelet lysis.
### When platelets take part in the formation of hemostatic plugs and thrombi in vivo, electron microscopic evidence indicates that some of the platelets not only release their granule contents but also undergo lysis. In the present study we have examined, in vitro, the relation between the release reaction of platelets and platelet lysis in response to the release-inducing agents thrombin and collagen. Release was measured by determining the amounts of 14C-serotonin and adenine nucleotides that appeared in the ambient fluid of prelabeled platelets. Lysis was measured by determining the amount of either lactate dehydrogenase or 14C-labeled cytoplasmic ATP from platelets incubated with -14C-adenosine. Washed platelets prepared from rabbit, pig, or human blood lost some lactate dehydrogenase and 14C-ATP upon exposure to thrombin, but the amounts of lactate dehydrogenase and 14C-ATP lost from rabbit platelets were much greater than from pig or human platelets. The reason for this species difference is not aparent. The platelet release reaction appeared to be necessary for lysis to occur. Reduction of the extent of the release reaction by preincubation of rabbit platelets with metabolic inhibitors to deplete metabolic ATP reduced the extent of lysis. In addition, it was apparent that the fall in platelet metabolic pool ATP caused by thrombin was not responsible for platelet lysis. Lack of calcium, addition of prostaglandin E(1), OR Increasing the albumin concentration of the suspending medium of rabbit platelets inhibited platelet lysis. These conditions may prevent the loss of material that causes lysis, inhibit the action of this lost material, or inhibit the lytic reaction. Release and lysis may occur together and release can occur without detectable lysis, but lysis in response to a release-inducing agent does not take place unless the release reaction occurs.

### Quantitative measurements of vancomycin binding to self-assembled peptide monolayers on chips by quartz crystal microbalance.
### This paper describes direct binding of a small vancomycin to peptide ligands immobilized on a sensor chip using quartz crystal microbalance. In this study, the binding ligands were composed of three components: a molecular recognition element (peptide), a conformationally flexible and hydrophilic linker, and a long-chain alkanethiol. These peptide ligands were used to establish the well-packed, self-assembled monolayers on quartz chips and could be readily synthesized using conventional organic chemistry protocols. Results of quartz crystal microbalance measurements showed that vancomycin specifically associated with the d-Ala-d-Ala-containing peptide with an affinity of 3.2+/-0.3 microM and was, as expected, completely inactive to the self-assembled monolayer presenting l-Ala-l-Ala peptide. The dissociation constant obtained correlated well with values reported in literature and was further confirmed by surface plasmon resonance measurement (2.7+/-0.7 microM). The technique used in this study should be applicable to both peptidyl and nonpeptidyl ligands of greater complexity than that used here. This method is practical, it provides quantitative binding information, and complicated analysis is avoided.

### [Scanning electron microscopic research on the clinical use of interdental stripping]
### The morphology of approximal enamel that has been stripped for therapeutic reasons was evaluated under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) twelve weeks and one year after treatment. In part one of the study the teeth were extracted before evaluation, in the second part replica were taken. For comparative reasons the morphology of the natural approximal enamel surface was evaluated under the SEM, too. After twelve weeks the edges of the furrows were seen to be smoother and plaque accumulations were found in the depths of the furrows. One year after there was found essentially no difference. In some of the specimens there was found a certain levelling of the edges in the approximal contact area, but not in the cervical region of the artificially abraded tooth surface. The natural enamel surface of the contact area showed excavations of similar size as the furrows that remain after stripping and finishing. But our study shows that the therapeutic approximal abrasion leaves furrows in the cervical region that even after one year had not undergone repair. The question is discussed, if thus predispositions for periodontal pathologies and caries could be created.

### Embryonic and early postnatal hippocampal cells respond to nanomolar concentrations of muscimol.
### Embryonic and early postnatal tissue taken from rat hippocampi were papain digested in order to obtain cell suspensions suitable for analysis in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Cell suspensions consisted of two major peaks of forward-angle light scatter (FALS). FACS analysis showed that the population which stained intensely with the vital dye Acridine orange (AO) scattered significant levels of light (high FALS) and amounted to 85% of the total events collected in embryonic cell suspensions and 65% in postnatal (PN) samples. Two minor populations were weakly stained with AO and scattered little light. Oxonol, a voltage-sensitive indicator dye, was used to detect membrane polarization changes. The AO and oxonol staining patterns were very similar. All the events exposed to media containing 50 mM KCl were depolarized (increase in intensity of oxonol fluorescence). The depolarizing effect of veratridine, a sodium channel activator, was more pronounced in the high FALS subpopulation. In embryonic hippocampal cell suspensions nanomolar concentrations of GABAA agonists depolarized the high FALS subpopulation in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was prevented by preincubation with bicuculline or picrotoxin. In hippocampal cell suspensions obtained from 5-7-day-old rat pups (PN5-7), GABAA agonists depolarized one cell subpopulation and hyperpolarized another. Our results indicate that physiological responses can be resolved in subpopulations of hippocampal cell suspensions by FACS analysis. This technique seems to be a sensitive assay to measure physiological responses (changes in membrane potential) as a parameter of receptor expression. GABAA agonists induced pure depolarizing responses in embryonic and early postnatal hippocampus when active neurogenesis is taking place. The response become hyperpolarizing-depolarizing ones after inhibitory synapses appear.

### 3156802
### Monoclonal antibody identification of mononuclear cells in endomyocardial biopsy specimens from a patient with rheumatic carditis.
### A 17-year-old woman with rheumatic carditis underwent endomyocardial biopsy both prior to and following treatment with prednisone and aspirin. Frozen sections from the endomyocardial biopsy specimens were studied with monoclonal antibodies by an indirect immunofluorescence technique to define the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in the myocardium and to determine whether the composition of the infiltrate is distinctive and diagnostically useful. The specimen from the initial biopsy contained a heterogeneous infiltrate composed of T lymphocytes, macrophages, B lymphocytes, and mast cells. T lymphocytes predominated, and the ratio of T-helper to T-cytotoxic/suppressor cells was 2.0. Following treatment the overall cellularity of the infiltrate was diminished, but the infiltrate remained heterogeneous; T cells predominated, and the T-helper to T-cytotoxic/suppressor ratio was reversed, to 0.59. The composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in this case of rheumatic carditis distinguishes it immunologically from other "idiopathic," presumably virus-associated, forms of myocarditis.

### 8973053
### Bioavailability and pharmacokinetic disposition of tacrine in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease.
### The pharmacokinetic disposition of intravenous and oral doses of tacrine was determined in 5 elderly patients (aged 64 to 96 y) with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The bioavailability of the oral formulation was low (9.9% to 36.4%), and the plasma half-life was not altered by route of drug delivery. These data indicate that tacrine elimination occurs by a 1st-order process. Plasma clearance of tacrine varied more than its half-life, which is consistent with a modulating effect of apparent volume of distribution (Vd). Our findings, together with other limited published studies, suggest that use of tacrine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be confounded by the high interindividual variability in its kinetic disposition.

### [Molecular basis of hereditary hemochromatosis]
### Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic metabolic disease characterized by increased intestinal iron absorption and progressive iron loading in the cells of various organs. Human body iron homeostasis involves a number of complicated processes, some of which are not identified yet. Genetic analysis of patients affected by HH recently led to the discovery of many novel proteins and mechanisms that can influence the uptake, transport, storage, and excretion of iron. It also showed that hemochromatosis is a very complex disease and that the type of mutation can influence its clinical manifestation. This review presents the current knowledge about the mechanisms of iron metabolism and describes the types of hereditary hemochromatosis and the mutations which induce the disease.

### 1307251
### Expression of four alternative dystrophin transcripts in brain regions regulated by different promoters.
### Cognitive impairment occurs in one-third of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a lethal X-linked, recessive disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene which is expressed in both brain and muscle, the two transcripts having alternative first exons. Previous reports have indicated that the 'brain-type' dystrophin transcript predominates in brain. Using in situ hybridisation with antisense oligonucleotides, expression of four distinct mRNAs in specific brain areas is demonstrated here; the 14 kb muscle-type and brain-type transcripts were found to coexist in cortical and hippocampal neurons and two new transcripts have been identified in dentate gyrus and cerebellar Purkinje neurons, respectively. The latter has a novel first exon which was isolated and sequenced from mouse and human, and which would encode a protein with a different amino-terminus from the known muscle- and brain-type isoforms. Mapping in human located this exon in a large intron between the muscle-type promoter and second exon of the dystrophin gene. This finding of four alternative transcripts regulated by different promoters in brain reveals a new complexity to dystrophin expression that may have important insights for mental retardation mechanisms.

### 194879
### Incidence of minor physical anomaly in autism.
### Children diagnosed as autistic were matched by age and sex with 74 control subjects and examined for presence of minor physical anomalies. Of the 16 anomalies scored, autistic children demonstrated a significant accumulation greater than the number exhibited by normal children. Three of the stigmata--low seating of ears, hypertelorism, and syndactylia--were expressed differentially in the two groups, and high palate as well as unusual cranial circumference were significantly high in both groups. Clusters of stigmata that might be associated with known chromosomal disorders could not be identified. The increased number of anomalies suggests that among autistic children such congenital markers indicate a deviant intrauterine experience.

### 1907044
### Six-hour porcine liver storage without flushing or perfusion.
### Livers from normal porcine donors were preserved by surface cooling only, without flushing or perfusion, for periods up to 24 hr. All recipients of livers stored for 6 hr survived until sacrifice at 7 days. In a separate, similar group, survival up to 21 days was noted. Only 2 of 6 recipients survived after 9-hr liver storage, but one of these lived for greater than 120 days. No animals survived longer than 2 days after transplantation of livers stored for 12 or 24 hr. The changes in plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase of recipients of 6-hr surface-cooled livers were not significantly different from AST levels of recipients of livers stored in University of Wisconsin or Euro-Collins solution as observed in previous studies in this laboratory. At sacrifice after 7 days, there was no histologic evidence of damage after surface cooling. In the light of recent reports of evidence of endothelial and reticuloendothelial damage caused by flushing solutions, it is suggested that surface cooling of the liver may provide adequate preservation for 6 hr in appropriate circumstances. Further studies will be needed to confirm that this method of preservation is applicable to livers removed from brain-dead donors and that it does not cause endothelial damage.

### 3548201
### The effect of nicotine and alcohol on the fertility and life span of rats. A cytological analysis.
### Inbred Fisher and Buffalo rats were exposed to nicotine and alcohol. Fertility was greatly reduced in both strains with nicotine treatments being much more deleterious than alcohol use. Fisher rats tolerated both toxins better than Buffalo rats. Both strains became 'extinct' after one generation of fetal and postnatal exposure to nicotine, but alcohol-ingesting Fisher rats had 3 or more generations of offspring. The total reproductive period was significantly shortened in both strains under the effect of both toxins, as was the total life span. The causes of the teratological effects of both toxins are inflammatory processes as evidenced by the presence of numerous lymphocytes and/or polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Their presence occurs earlier in nicotine than in alcohol use and earlier in Buffalo than in Fisher rats, but the damage done during nicotine treatment is reversible when the procedure is terminated. Inflammation is not transmitted to the newborn offspring of nicotine- or alcohol-treated mothers, but occurs in neonates during the nursing period or later. There is considerable individual variation in the tolerance to both toxins. Experimental results and clinical observations show a sufficient number of similarities to justify the use of experimental data as a model for further studies on human subjects.

### 11594451
### Pathogenesis of virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination.
### Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease has been extensively studied as an attractive infectious model for human multiple sclerosis. Virus-specific inflammatory Th1 cell responses followed by autoimmune responses to myelin antigens play a crucial role in the pathogenic processes leading to demyelination. Antibody and cytotoxic T cells (CTL) responses to virus appears to be primarily protective from demyelinating disease. Although the role of Th1 and CTL responses in the induction of demyelinating disease is controversial, assessment of cytokines produced locally in the central nervous system (CNS) during the course of disease and the effects of altered inflammatory cytokine levels strongly support the importance of Th1 responses in this virus-induced demyelinating disease. Induction of various chemokines and cytokines in different glial and antigen presenting cells upon viral infection appears to be an important initiation mechanism for inflammatory Th1 responses in the CNS. Coupled with the initial inflammatory responses, viral persistence in the CNS may be a critical factor for sustaining inflammatory responses and consequent immune-mediated demyelinating disease.

### 2916286
### Paratesticular metastases from congenital retroperitoneal tumor.
### A retroperitoneal tumor was removed from a fifteen-day-old infant. Light microscopy revealed a teratoma consisting mainly of immature nervous tissue. Three months later the patient had recurrence and numerous peritoneal metastases showing a histologic pattern similar to that of the primary tumor. Twelve months later there was enlargement of the left testis due to metastases from teratoma infiltrating the tunica vaginalis of the left testis, the epididymis, and the spermatic cord. These metastases consisted of mature neurons and glial cells. The early dissemination of the tumor suggests an intracavitary spread pattern. The tumor maturation in paratesticular structures suggests that mesothelial cells are involved in the differentiation of tumoral germ cells.

### 8518099
### Intraperitoneal production of erythropoietin with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
### Higher hematocrit and serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels have previously been shown in end-stage renal disease patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) compared with hemodialysis. We investigated whether EPO was produced intraperitoneally in CAPD patients. EPO concentration was 3.5 +/- 0.3 mU/ml by radioimmunoassay in 26 samples of peritoneal dialysis effluent obtained from 15 CAPD patients. EPO was not detectable in the fresh unused dialysate. No correlation was observed between EPO levels in the serum and dialysis effluent. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from the dialysis effluent of 9 CAPD patients after an overnight dwell. The culture supernatant obtained after 24 h of in vitro culture of a million cells yielded EPO of 3.5 +/- 0.3 mU/ml. Our study demonstrated that peritoneal macrophages from CAPD patients produce EPO on in vitro stimulation, and EPO is present in the dialysis effluent of CAPD patients.

### Electroencephalographic sleep profiles during depression. Effects of episode duration and other clinical and psychosocial factors in older adults.
### BACKGROUND: Limited evidence suggests that polysomnographic alterations may be more prominent early in a depressive episode. Whether the effects of episode duration extend beyond middle age and appear in late-life depression as well has important implications for treatment decisions and for understanding depressive illness across the life span. Furthermore, the impact of episode duration on sleep has not been examined in the context of other factors related to clinical history and psychosocial status. METHODS: Eighty-three persons aged 60 years or older with recurrent depression were studied: 34 had been depressed for 2 to 16 weeks and 49 for longer periods. An age- and gender-matched group of 48 persons with no history of major depression served as controls. Initial univariate analyses examined duration effects on electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep measurements. Multivariate analyses considered the combined effects of episode duration, clinical variables, and psychosocial variables on EEG sleep profile. RESULTS: Episode duration was strongly associated with sleep continuity, architecture, and rapid eye movement: subjects who were earlier in their depressive episodes had their sleep impaired more than those later in their episodes, who, in turn, were more impaired than controls. Moreover, clinical characteristics of subjects' depressive illness, demographic variables, and psychosocial stressors and supports had unique effects on the EEG sleep profile. CONCLUSION: Episode duration appears to be a potent factor to consider when evaluating sleep during depression. The additional contribution of clinical and psychosocial characteristics to the prediction of the EEG sleep profile demonstrates the importance of incorporating these variables into models of the psychobiologic characteristics of depression. The results are relevant to the timing and focus of therapeutic interventions.

### Increased catecholamines and heart rate in children with low birth weight: perinatal contributions to sympathoadrenal overactivity.
### BACKGROUND: Low birth weight is associated with cardiovascular disease. The underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that perinatal stress alters autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system. In this study, catecholamines, heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were measured in healthy children with low birth weight. METHODS: This clinical study included 105 children (mean age 9.6 years) in three groups; born at term with normal birth weight (controls, n=37), born at term but small for gestational age (SGA, n=29) and born preterm (Preterm, n=39). Dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline were determined in urine. HR and BP were measured at rest, during an orthostatic test and after a mathematical mental stress test. RESULTS: Children in the Preterm and SGA groups excreted higher levels of catecholamines when compared with controls. HR (mean [SD] values) were higher at rest and after mental stress in Preterm (at rest 76 [9] and after mental stress 82 [12] min(-1)) and in SGA (79 [8] and 82 [10]) when compared with controls (70 [9] and 75 [9]). HR correlated with urinary catecholamines (r=0.24-0.27, P<0.05). Blood pressures measured at rest, during orthostatic testing and after mental stress did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm birth and fetal growth restriction are associated with increased sympathoadrenal activity in childhood, as indicated by stress-induced increases in HR and urinary catecholamines. These findings suggest that the cardiovascular control is differently programmed in these children with possibly higher risk of developing hypertension in adulthood.

### 15189789
### Relational factors in understanding satisfaction in the lasting relationships of same sex and heterosexual couples.
### Satisfying relationships are important to the well-being of individuals and families. Because of increased longevity, many couples are staying together for extended periods of time. Thus, it is valuable to understand the factors that contribute to a sense of satisfaction among partners in lasting relationships. Relatively little attention has been paid in the research literature to relationships among older couples who have remained together for many years. Even less attention has been paid to the lasting relationships of couples of color and to gay male and lesbian couples. This paper focuses on understanding the factors that contribute to satisfaction of partners in the long-term relationships of a purposive sample of heterosexual and same-sex couples. Data was collected through in-depth interviews with 216 partners in 108 relationships that had lasted an average of 30 years. Using logistic regression analysis, two factors were identified as predictive of satisfaction during the recent years of these relationships: containment of relational conflict and psychologically intimate communication between partners. Based on these findings, a theoretical model for understanding satisfaction in lasting relationships is discussed.

### 7850781
### Amplification at 12q13-14 in human malignant gliomas is frequently accompanied by loss of heterozygosity at loci proximal and distal to the amplification site.
### We have recently reported that a subset of human malignant gliomas shows amplification and overexpression of multiple genes from chromosomal segment 12q13-14, including CDK4, SAS, and MDM2. In the present study we have performed an allelotyping for 16 polymorphic loci spanning both arms of chromosome 12 in a series of 136 gliomas. Allelic deletions were found in 50% (7 of 14) of the malignant gliomas with 12q13-14 amplification and involved loci located on 12q proximal and distal to the amplification site. In contrast, the incidence of allelic loss on chromosome 12 was significantly lower in gliomas without 12q13-14 amplification [14% (11 of 79) in the WHO grade III and IV gliomas, 9% (4 of 43) in the WHO grade I and II gliomas]. The frequent association between 12q13-14 amplification and loss of alleles from 12q is in line with a model suggesting chromosome breakage and deletion as important events in the development of gene amplification.

### 11253357
### Neural basis of deciding, choosing and acting.
### The ability and opportunity to make decisions and carry out effective actions in pursuit of goals is central to intelligent life. Recent research has provided significant new insights into how the brain arrives at decisions, makes choices, and produces and evaluates the consequences of actions. In fact, by monitoring or manipulating specific neurons, certain choices can now be predicted or manipulated.

### The inshore areas of Tabarka and Bizerte are not submitted to the bacterian pollution. The "Old Port" of Bizerte is mainly contaminated all the year round and sometimes polluted the neighbouring urban beach. The lagoon of Bizerte presents any bacterian pollution and could be adapted to the conchyliculture and to the stabulation of Bivalves, with before some important precautions.

### 12335357
### The effect of education of women and urbanization on actual and desired fertility and on fertility control in Lebanon.
### The influence of education of women and urbanization on actual and desired fertility and on fertility control in Lebanon was examined.  Data were used from 1 study conducted in the Nabatieh district of South Lebanon in the summer of 1976 and from a 2nd study conducted in 1970 in an area on the outskirts of the capital city of Beirut.  The total number of completed interviews in the Nabatieh sample was 1054.  This population consisted mostly of Shiites with Christian and Sunni minorities.  The urban sample consisted of 1545 Shiite and 1459 Maronite.  The examination revealed that: 1) among the rural sample, a relatively high level of education (beyond the primary level) is necessary to induce a substantial decrease in average children ever born;  2) a comparison of rural and urban samples showed the effect of the education variable was dependent on religious affiliation - the Shiite women at low levels of education demonstrated higher fertility than Maronite women, but they responded more to an improvement in education in the urban area;  3) women urban residents showed lower fertility than women rural dwellers, controlling for religion and age;  4) the rural study conducted 5 years after the urban study showed a lower level of desired fertility;  and 5) the Shiite women (who are a majority of the women in South Lebanon) revealed a tendency to use modern contraceptive methods, particularly the oral contraceptive, suggesting a receptivity in the area to the Lebanon Family Planning Associations project of Community Based Family Planning Services.

### 17204400
### Chemosensitisation of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive yeast cells to antifungals.
### Multidrug resistance in yeast results from overexpression of genes encoding drug efflux transporters owing to gain-of-function mutations in transcription factors regulating their expression. We have screened a library of synthetic compounds for modulators of drug resistance using the multidrug-resistant Saccharomyces cerevisiae pdr3-9 mutant strain. One of the compounds, 7-chlorotetrazolo[5,1-c]benzo[1,2,4]triazine (CTBT), displayed weak antifungal activity and strongly inhibited the growth of yeast cells in combination with subinhibitory concentrations of other antifungals with a different mode of action. Biological activity of CTBT was demonstrated in Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces and Candida yeast species grown on solid and in liquid media. The chemosensitising effect of CTBT, manifested as increased antifungal activity of fluconazole, was demonstrated in yeast mutant strains with deleted genes encoding the major multidrug resistance transcription factors Yap1p, Pdr1p and Pdr3p as well as the drug efflux pumps Pdr5p and Snq2p in S. cerevisiae or their counterparts in Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, named Cdr1p and Mdr1p, respectively. Importantly, CTBT also increased the sensitivity to fluconazole in multidrug-resistant cells overexpressing the efflux pumps. Yeast cells grown in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of CTBT exhibited an altered sterol composition and a slightly enhanced accumulation of Rhodamine 6G, which suggests that the plasma membrane plays a role in sensitisation. This novel chemosensitisation by CTBT that can overcome multidrug resistance in yeast may prove useful in combined treatment of infections caused by drug-resistant fungal pathogens.

### [Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy]
### The rare association of Cushing's syndrome and pregnancy is explained by the amenorrhea and sterility inherent to the syndrome. In the literature, 125 cases have been reported: 30 cases of early diagnosis and 95 others diagnosed in the second half of pregnancy. AT THE START OF PREGNANCY: When hypercorticism exists before pregnancy it is hardly secretory. Its diagnosis, at an early stage, is not hindered by the hormone modifications of pregnancy. Its aetiological treatment raises the problem of the compatibility in pursuing the latter. IN THE SECOND HALF OF PREGNANCY: The positive and aetiological diagnoses of Cushing's syndrome are difficult and its prevalence may therefore be underestimated. The evocative clinical signs are unspecific: excessive weight gain, hypertension of pregnancy and gestational diabetes. The 24-hour free hypercortisoluria and the absence of dexamethasone inhibition are of little diagnostic value after the 14th week of amenorrhea. The positive diagnosis therefore relies essentially on the abolition of the circadian rhythm of cortisol. The biological hyperandrogenia commonly observed is not discriminating. Adrenal aetiologies are frequent. Imaging must be performed to eliminate an adrenocortical tumor. PROGNOSIS: The maternal prognosis depends on the hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes and the complications of Cushing's syndrome. It depends on the activity of the hypercorticism and its early aetiological treatment, which must not be delayed after pregnancy. The foetal prognosis depends on the maternal prognosis. It is represented by preterm delivery, hypotrophy and death of the foetus in utero. The therapeutic management must be symptomatic and aetiologic, maternal and obstetrical.

### 17612189
### Substrate-enhanced microbial fuel cells for improved remote power generation from sediment-based systems.
### A sediment microbial fuel cell (MFC) produces electricity through the bacterial oxidation of organic matter contained in the sediment. The power density is limited, however, due in part to the low organic matter content of most marine sediments. To increase power generation from these devices, particulate substrates were added to the anode compartment. Three materials were tested: two commercially available chitin products differing in particle size and biodegradability (Chitin 20 and Chitin 80) and cellulose powder. Maximum power densities using chitin in this substrate-enhanced sediment MFC (SEM) were 76 +/- 25 and 84 +/- 10 mW/m2 (normalized to cathode projected surface area) for Chitin 20 and Chitin 80, respectively, versus less than 2 mW/m2 for an unamended control. Power generation over a 10 day period averaged 64 +/- 27 mW/ m2 (Chitin 20) and 76 +/- 15 mW/m2 (Chitin 80). With cellulose, a similar maximum power was initially generated (83 +/- 3 mW/m2), but power rapidly decreased after only 20 h. Maximum power densities over the next 5 days varied substantially among replicate cellulose-fed reactors, ranging from 29 +/- 12 to 62 +/- 23 mW/m2. These results suggest a new approach to power generation in remote areas based on the use of particulate substrates. While the longevity of the SEM was relatively short in these studies, it is possible to increase operation times by controlling particle size, mass, and type of material needed to achieve desired power levels that could theoretically be sustained over periods of years or even decades.

### Evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 coreceptor usage during antiretroviral Therapy: a Bayesian approach.
### There is substantial evidence for ongoing replication and evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), even in individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Viral evolution in the presence of antiviral therapy needs to be considered when developing new therapeutic strategies. Phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 sequences can be used for this purpose but may give rise to misleading results if rates of intrapatient evolution differ significantly. To improve analyses of HIV-1 evolution relevant to studies of pathogenesis and treatment, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical model that incorporates all available sequence data while simultaneously allowing the phylogenetic parameters of each patient to vary. We used this method to examine evolutionary changes in HIV-1 coreceptor usage in response to treatment. We examined patients whose viral populations exhibited a shift in coreceptor utilization in response to therapy. CXCR4 (X4) strains emerged in each patient but were suppressed following initiation of new antiretroviral regimens, so that CCR5-utilizing (R5) strains predominated. By phylogenetically reconstructing the evolutionary relationship of HIV-1 obtained longitudinally from each patient, it was possible to examine the origin of the reemergent R5 virus. Using our Bayesian hierarchical approach, we found that the reemergent R5 virus detectable after therapy was more closely related to the predecessor R5 virus than to the X4 strains. The Bayesian hierarchical approach, unlike more traditional methods, makes it possible to evaluate competing hypotheses across patients. This model is not limited to analyses of HIV-1 but can be used to elucidate evolutionary processes for other organisms as well.

### Dental service rates: age, period, and cohort effects.
### OBJECTIVE: Variation in dental service provision over time has been related to changes in factors such as oral health and demographics. Dentist factors such as age and cohort effects are also potential sources of influence. The aim of the study was to examine the operation of age, period, and cohort factors on variation in service rates. BASIC RESEARCH DESIGN: data were collected by a mailed survey of a random sample of 10% of male and 40% of female dentists from each state/territory of Australia in 1983-84, 1988-89. and 1993-94 with response rates of 73, 75 and 74% respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on main areas of service were obtained from a log of service items provided on a typical day. RESULTS: Poisson regressions of rates for the 10 main areas of service over time showed increased rates over the study period for diagnostic, preventive, endodontic, crown and bridge, general/miscellaneous and orthodontic services, and decreased rates of prosthodontic services. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that models for periodontal and endodontic services had a good fit. However, only endodontic services were readily interpretable in terms of descriptive trends. While the age-period-cohort model was preferred, age-period and age-cohort models were also examined because of problems of identification with age-period-cohort models. Endodontic rates were higher among younger dentist birth cohorts, and increased over the 10-year study period for most cohorts of dentists. CONCLUSIONS: If these effects for dentist cohorts were extrapolated over the next 10-year interval, the distribution of services would alter, with endodontic services emerging as a dominant area behind restorative, diagnostic, and preventive services.

### 16617726
### [The phenotypical review of patients with sleep apnea syndrome]
### Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is common with obesity. This may be a risk factor for the evolution of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders. The aim of the study was to estimate, how is the frequency of adiposity, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia by the SAS patients. Material and methods. On the basis of questionnaire SAS was suspected in 770 patients. The preliminary investigation was MESAM 4, and revealed 110 patients with desaturation during sleep. In all of them polisomnografic examination confirmed diagnosis. Glucose and lipides values and also description of: gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) was analysed. Conclusions: The analysis of the obtained results show the dependence of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and BMI, glucose and lipids values. The most frequent features in SAS patients is obesity, diabetes mellitus was the second one, hyperlipidemia was seldom observed.

### 234015
### Oxygen binding by hemocyanin from Levantina hierosolima. I. Exclusion of subunit interactions as a basis for cooperativity.
### The effect of oxygen on the distribution of hemocyanin from Levantina hierosolima among the three sedimenting species 20, 60, and 100 S was determined under two sets of experimental conditions: (a) at pH 7.63 in the absence of Ca2+, where oxygen binding in noncooperative; (b) at pH 8.20 in the presence of 2 x 10-3 M Ca2+, where oxygen binding is cooperative. A comparison of the results in the two cases eliminates the possibility that equilibrium between species with different oxygen affinities is responsible for the cooperative behavior. Cooperative oxygen binding was demonstrated for the 20S subunits at pH 8.80 and 1 x 10-3 M Ca2+. Under these conditions, the concentration of calcium is sufficient to affect the oxygen affinity, but the concentration of calcium plus proton is not sufficient to bring about association. The findings exclude interactions among 20S subunits as a basis for cooperativity in hemocyanin.

### 9745218
### [Studies for dynamics of reverse transcriptase inhibiting antibody in sera from HIV-1 infected individuals]
### Antibodies inhibiting human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase activity (RTI-antibody), Binding inhibition antibody (BI-antibody) and polymerization inhibition antibody (PI-antibody) were investigated for their ability to inhibiting RT activity in 248 HIV-1 infected individuals and 99 healthy individuals. In BI-antibody, high titer samples were determined more in than in RTI- and PI-antibodies. No significance was indicated between AC, ARC and AIDS is any antibody, however, progression from AC to AIDS was poled to high titer and low titer in RTI- and BI-antibodies. Moreover, time course of each antibody levels in the same infected individuals were resulted in no change, going up or down through all the experimental term, though all samples were collected in AC. These results were suggested that the determination factor of each stage in HIV progression would be multiple, and that the various dynamics of RTI-, BI- and PI-antibodies in the same infected individuals might be caused in the term from HIV infection to AIDS progression, prognosis or appearing of the drug resistant strain but stages of the disease.

### 8524975
### Serotonergic modulation of anticholinergic effects on cognition and behavior in elderly humans.
### Cholinergic neurotransmission is thought to be modulated by serotonin as documented in animal and human studies. We examined the effects of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (0.4 mg IV) given alone or together with the serotonin mixed agonist/antagonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP, 0.08 mg/kg IV), and the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg IV). Ten normal elderly volunteers each received five separate pharmacologic challenges (placebo, ondansetron, scopolamine, scopolamine+ondansetron, and scopolamine+m-CPP). Cognitive, behavioral, and physiologic variables were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. The acute effects of scopolamine in certain cognitive, behavioral, and physiological measures were significantly exaggerated by the addition of m-CPP. Scopolamine's cognitive effects were unaffected by ondansetron at the dose tested, nor did ondansetron given alone affect basal cognitive performance. This pilot study suggests that the serotonin mixed agonist/antagonist m-CPP may influence cholinergic neurotransmission. The changes associated with the combination of scopolamine and m-CPP do not appear to be secondary to simple pharmacokinetic alterations and suggest a complex interaction between the cholinergic and serotonergic systems centrally.

### 6348080
### Ganglioside GM1 enzyme-linked immunospot assay for simple identification of heat-labile enterotoxin-producing Escherichia coli.
### A new method has been developed for demonstration of heat-labile (LT) enterotoxin produced by Escherichia coli. This method is based upon the release of LT from bacteria grown directly onto agar plates which have been coated with ganglioside GM1. Toxin bound to the GM1 solid state is subsequently demonstrated by means of a three-step immunoenzymatic procedure in which enzyme-substrate reactions are visualized as dark spots in agarose. When analyzing LT production from 105 E. coli strains, results obtained by this procedure (GM1-ELISPOT) correlated well with those of the GM1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (GM1-ELISA); in no instance were any false-positive reactions observed when highly specific monoclonal antibodies against LT were used. Easy to perform, the GM1-ELISPOT allows demonstration of LT within 24 h after inoculation of the plates, and large numbers of specimens can be screened at the same time without the need of any special equipment. Thus, this new method should meet the requirements of any diagnostic laboratory.

### Comparisons of maternal and perinatal outcomes in Taiwanese women with complete and partial HELLP syndrome and women with severe pre-eclampsia without HELLP.
### AIM: To analyze the variations between maternal complications and perinatal outcome among women with complete hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, partial HELLP syndrome, and women with severe pre-eclampsia and normal laboratory tests. We also examine the effect of corticosteroid therapy for treatment of HELLP. METHODS: In this retrospective study, six patients with complete HELLP syndrome and 46 with partial HELLP syndrome, were compared and contrasted with 212 patients with severe pre-eclampsia but without HELLP syndrome. RESULTS: In Protocol 1, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was the strongest morbidity factor associated with patients among complete HELLP, partial HELLP, and severe pre-eclampsia. After post-hoc analysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was the significant outcome variable between complete and partial HELLP. In Protocol 2, after adjustment, we found that MODS (adjusted OR, 15.2, 95% CI, 6.18-35.53; P < 0.001); Apgar score less than 5 at 1 minute (adjusted OR, 2.17, 95% CI, 0.94-5.01; P = 0.069) and DIC (adjusted OR, 9.51, 95% CI, 1.68-53.7, P = 0.011) remained significantly associated with HELLP syndrome. There was a favorable outcome found in the complete HELLP group. Neither the dexamethasone group nor the aggressive therapy group could benefit from the treatment protocol. CONCLUSION: The different categories of HELLP syndrome, the protocol 1 and protocol 2 have been noted as differential effects on pregnancy outcome. MODS and DIC would be two significant outcome variables and corticosteroid therapy may not benefit HELLP patients.

### 17171665
### Evaluation of association of SNPs in the TNF alpha gene region with schizophrenia.
### The association of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) -G308A promoter polymorphism with schizophrenia has complemented clinical findings of increased levels of the TNFalpha cytokine in schizophrenic patients, with some support for a functional consequence of the variant. Our previous studies of genetic causes in schizophrenia supported findings of linkage to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region where the TNFalpha gene is located as well as association with the -G308A promoter polymorphism. While the common G-allele shows association in our sample, association with the A-allele has been reported by other groups. This suggests linkage disequilibrium (LD) rather than direct involvement in the disorder. In order to define LD of DNA variants with the disorder in this area, we analyzed 36 SNPs in a 165-kb region around this polymorphism. We detected nominally significant associations (P < 0.05) of three markers (including the -G308A promoter polymorphism) and multiple haplotypes with schizophrenia in our sample of 204 families (79 sib-pairs and 125 trios). The association is largely restricted to a 30 kb high LD region/block and should assist in the identification of a schizophrenia susceptibility gene within the block or elsewhere in the MHC.

### A predictive model for survival in metastatic cancer patients attending an outpatient palliative radiotherapy clinic.
### PURPOSE: To develop a predictive model for survival from the time of presentation in an outpatient palliative radiotherapy clinic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen factors were analyzed prospectively in 395 patients seen in a dedicated palliative radiotherapy clinic in a large tertiary cancer center using Cox's proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: Six prognostic factors had a statistically significant impact on survival, as follows: primary cancer site, site of metastases, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), and fatigue, appetite, and shortness of breath scores from the modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. Risk group stratification was performed (1) by assigning weights to the prognostic factors based on their levels of significance, and (2) by the number of risk factors present. The weighting method provided a Survival Prediction Score (SPS), ranging from 0 to 32. The survival probability at 3, 6, and 12 months was 83%, 70%, and 51%, respectively, for patients with SPS <or=13 (n = 133); 67%, 41%, and 20% for patients with SPS 14-19 (n = 129); and 36%, 18%, and 4% for patients with SPS >or=20 (n = 133) (p < 0.0001). Corresponding survival probabilities based on number of risk factors were as follows: 85%, 72%, and 52% (<or=3 risk factors)(n = 98); 68%, 47%, and 24% (4 risk factors)(n = 117); and 46%, 24%, and 11% (>or=5 factors)(n = 180)(p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Clinical prognostic factors can be used to predict prognosis among patients attending a palliative radiotherapy clinic. If validated in an independent series of patients, the model can be used to guide clinical decisions, plan supportive services, and allocate resource use.

### 17595369
### Critical care nurses' knowledge of evidence-based guidelines for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia: an evaluation questionnaire.
### BACKGROUND: Nurses' lack of knowledge may be a barrier to adherence to evidence-based guidelines for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: To develop a reliable and valid questionnaire for evaluating critical care nurses' knowledge of evidence-based guidelines for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia. METHODS: Ten nursing-related interventions were identified from a review of evidence-based guidelines for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia. Selected interventions and multiple-choice questions (1 question per intervention) were subjected to face and content validation. Item difficulty, item discrimination, and the quality of the response alternatives or options for answers (possible responses) were evaluated on the test results of 638 critical care nurses. RESULTS: Face and content validity were achieved for 9 items. Values for item difficulty ranged from 0.1 to 0.9. Values for item discrimination ranged from 0.10 to 0.65. The quality of the response alternatives led to the detection of widespread misconceptions among critical care nurses. CONCLUSION: The questionnaire is reliable and has face and content validity. Results of surveys with this questionnaire can be used to focus educational programs on preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.

### 16217387
### Urinary response to an oxalic acid load is influenced by the timing of calcium loading in rats.
### PURPOSE: Dietary intake of calcium or dairy products has been shown to decrease urinary oxalate excretion by limiting its intestinal absorption. However, not enough attention has been given to whether there is any benefit from altering the schedule of ingesting calcium and oxalate. Therefore, we investigated the effects of changes in the timing of calcium and oxalate loading on urinary oxalate excretion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats weighing 180 to 200 gm were fasted and randomized into several groups. They were then administered normal saline or oxalic acid with or without calcium or milk. Calcium or milk was given immediately, or 5, 10, 15 or 30 minutes before or after the oxalate load. All treatments were given via gastrostomy. Urine samples were collected by bladder puncture just before administration and at hourly intervals up to 5 hours afterward. Urinary oxalate was measured by capillary electrophoresis. RESULTS: Urinary oxalate increased after the administration of oxalate alone, while it decreased when oxalate was combined with calcium or milk. Urinary oxalate showed a smaller increment when calcium or milk was given before than after oxalate loading, and it was much smaller when calcium or milk was given immediately before oxalate. CONCLUSIONS: Prior calcium loading appears to have a positive influence on decreasing oxalic acid absorption from the intestinal tract. Therefore, calcium or dairy products should always be ingested before a meal rich in oxalate to prevent oxalate absorption and decrease urinary oxalate excretion.

### 15833274
### Subcellular recruitment by TSG118 and TSPYL implicates a role for zinc finger protein 106 in a novel developmental pathway.
### To gain insight into the function of zinc finger protein 106 (ZFP106), we analyzed its subcellular targeting and identified its interacting proteins. Although ZFP106 was detected predominantly in the fibrillar component of the nucleolus and co-localized with the nucleolar transcriptional machinery, its overexpression did not affect transcription of pre-ribosomal RNA genes. The nucleolar association of ZFP106 did neither require ongoing ribosomal RNA synthesis nor nucleolar chromatin indicating that a protein-protein interaction confines ZFP106 to the nucleolus. Deletion analysis revealed that the C-terminal WD40 repeat region functions in nucleolar targeting. This domain interacts with the product of testis-specific gene 118 (TSG118), which also co-localizes with ZFP106 in the nucleolus. Rapid downregulation of TSG118 expression during in vitro terminal differentiation coincides with a loss of nucleolar ZFP106. By its structural features and expression, TSG118 mimics nucleostemin, a nucleolar protein linked to the proliferation potential of stem cells. A two-hybrid screen with the N-terminal region of ZFP106 as bait led to the isolation of testis-specific Y-encoded-like protein (TSPYL), a member of the nucleosome assembly protein family. A frame-shift mutation in TSPYL has recently been found to cause a sudden infant death syndrome with testis dysgenesis. Specific recruitment of ZFP106 via amino acids 412-781 into TSPYL-positive nucleoplasmic bodies requires a TSPYL domain absent in the mutant protein of patients with testis dysgenesis. These results identify ZFP106 as a potential player in a novel pathway involved in testis development.

### 1781794
### Effect of vitamin D deficiency on D-glucose and citrate transport in rat renal basolateral membrane vesicles.
### We had previously reported that feeding rats on Steenbock and Black's rickets-inducing diet markedly influences the metabolic picture of the kidney and the transmembrane transport systems of D-glucose and citrate in renal brush-border membrane vesicles. We have now studied D-glucose and citrate transport into basolateral membrane vesicles prepared from kidney cortex of control and rachitic rats and the effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on these transport systems was also investigated. D-glucose and citrate uptake, determined in the presence of a Na(+)-gradient, was lowered in rachitic animals and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 administration proved to be ineffective in restoring normal values. Citrate transport, determined in the presence of a K(+)-gradient, was not influenced by both rickets and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 supply. The in vitro addition to vesicle preparations of calcium or phosphate or citrate or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 did not show a selective influence on D-glucose and citrate uptake.

### 15849956
### [AIDS and hemophilia in pediatrics: report of a case]
### It is reported the case of a 12-year-old white school boy with diagnosis of degree III hemophilia A since he was 2 months old that had received innumerable transfusions of cryoprecipitate and several of blood. In 1999, he was diagnosed hepatitis C and, at the end of 2000, HIV infection. There was a high possibility of having acquired them both by the blood and hemoderivative transfusions received. As very low figures of TCD4 lymphocytes (4%) with 54 cells/mm3 were corroborated on conducting immunological studies, it was classified as group B-3 AIDS, according to the classification established by the CDC of Atlanta, in 1994. He was indicated antiretroviral treatment with tritherapy (d4T, 3TC and Nelfinavir). This case was reported to call the attention of doctors at the time of indicating treatment with antivirals or protease-inhibitors to fight AIDS in pediatric cases with diagnosis of hemophilia, since some of them may cause spontaneous bleeding episodes.

### 6120076
### Regulation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone secretion from frog skin.
### The regulation of TRH secretion from skin fragments of the leopard frog, Rana pipiens, was examined under various conditions. TRH secretion is under dual neurotransmitter control with stimulatory noradrenergic and inhibitory dopaminergic components; other neurotransmitters were generally without effect. Membrane-depolarizing conditions required the presence of calcium to cause TRH release consistent with a stimulus-secretion coupling mechanism. However, the norepinephrine-stimulated response appeared to be independent of external Ca++. TRH secretion was unresponsive to somatostatin, T3, and dibutyryl cAMP, substances which may affect TRH secretion in the mammalian hypothalamus. Anuran skin is a complex secretory tissue, but the presence of large quantities of TRH and other biologically active neuropeptides makes this tissue an attractive model to study the regulation of neuropeptide secretion.

### 114946
### Biofeedback training and relaxation exercises for treatment of temporomandibular joint dysfunction.
### Biofeedback training involves electromyographic recording of the patient's level of facial muscle tension with concurrent presentation of that level to the patient in a visual or auditory manner. The objective of biofeedback training in patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction is to provide them with an insight into abnormal facial muscle activities, which include clenching and grinding of the teeth and lip- and cheek-biting habits. This insight coupled with relaxation programs affords the patient an opportunity to eliminate abnormal behavior patterns that foster temporomandibular joint symptomatology.

### 15238425
### Reactive oxygen species limit neutrophil life span by activating death receptor signaling.
### Neutrophils are abundant, short-lived leukocytes, and their death by apoptosis is central to hemostasis and the resolution of inflammation, yet the trigger for their entry into apoptosis is unknown. We show here that death receptor signaling, including CD95 death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation and caspase 8 activation, occurred early in neutrophil apoptosis. However, death receptor ligation was not required for apoptosis, suggesting a novel mechanism for caspase 8 activation. We detected ceramide generation and clustering of CD95 in lipid rafts early in neutrophil apoptosis, and neutrophil apoptosis and ceramide generation were both significantly inhibited in acid sphingomyelinase knockout (ASM(-/-)) mice compared to wild-type littermates. Further studies revealed that ceramide generation, CD95 clustering, and neutrophil apoptosis were dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROSs) and were preceded by a fall in reduced glutathione levels. We propose that accumulation of ROSs, as a consequence of altered redox status, initiates ligand-independent death receptor signaling via activation of ASM and clustering of preformed DISC components in lipid rafts and is therefore a primary factor limiting neutrophil life span.

### 3342503
### Differential precipitation of isolated human plasma lipoproteins with heparin and manganese chloride.
### We studied the precipitation of isolated lipoproteins with heparin and MnCl2. Lipoproteins were isolated from human plasma by preparative ultracentrifugation and their free cholesterol was labeled. Each lipoprotein fraction was then precipitated at various pHs, with or without bovine serum albumin (60 g/L) present. Under no set of conditions was one class of lipoproteins completely separated from the other two. Specifically, under standard conditions for precipitation of serum lipoproteins (pH 7.4 and protein 60 g/L), 12% of the very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and 8% of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) remained in the supernatant liquid, and 30% of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was precipitated. These results indicate that, under these conditions, so-called HDL cholesterol may be a mixture of VLDL, LDL, and HDL, although the sum of the amount of these three fractions remaining in the supernate is fortuitously very close to the value for HDL cholesterol isolated by ultracentrifugation.

### Heart rate differences between right and left unilateral electroconvulsive therapy.
### Left and right unilateral electrode placements were alternately applied in electroconvulsive therapy given to 21 men with melancholia. Accompanying heart rate elevations were greater following right unilateral treatment than left unilateral, apparently because of longer persistence of peak rates. This is consistent with right cerebral hemisphere superiority in the control of heart rate activity in neurologically intact humans.

### Soft-tissue releases to treat spastic hip subluxation in children with cerebral palsy.
### BACKGROUND: Spastic hip subluxation and dislocation are common problems in children with cerebral palsy. Soft-tissue releases have proved to be beneficial in the prevention of spastic hip dislocation. A protocol for treatment based on patient age, hip abduction, and hip migration percentage was established in 1988. The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome in sixty-five children treated according to this protocol and followed for a minimum of eight years. METHODS: The medical records and radiographs of sixty-five children, from an original series of seventy-four patients, who met the inclusion criteria were available for review. Forty-seven children had spastic quadriplegia and were unable to walk; eighteen children had spastic diplegia and were able to walk independently or with assistive devices. The mean age at the time of the surgery was 4.4 years. Open adductor tenotomy and psoas muscle recession or iliopsoas tenotomy were performed on 129 hips, which were followed for a mean of 10.8 years. The mean age at the time of follow-up was fifteen years. Hips were grouped according to the hip migration percentage preoperatively, at one year postoperatively, and at the time of final follow-up. The final outcome for the patient was defined according to the worse hip. An analysis was performed to identify potential factors influencing outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (49%) had a good result, eleven (17%) had a fair result, three (4%) had a poor result, and nineteen (30%) had a failure. The mean hip migration percentage was 34% preoperatively and 18% at the time of final follow-up. Nineteen patients required subsequent osseous reconstructive procedures, and eleven required repeat soft-tissue releases. The migration percentage at one year postoperatively was the most predictive of the final outcome (p = 0.001). Patients who had been able to walk preoperatively had a better long-term outcome (p = 0.01). Neither the preoperative hip migration percentage nor the age at surgery significantly affected the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Soft-tissue release was effective for long-term prevention of hip dislocation in 67% (forty-three) of sixty-five children with spastic hip subluxation. Two preoperative factors that were related to a favorable outcome were a spastic diplegic pattern of involvement and the ability to walk. The hip migration percentage at one year postoperatively was a good predictor of final outcome.

### Some factors which affect the initiation of growth of Cryptococcus neoformans.
### Howard, Dexter H. (University of California, Los Angeles). Some factors which affect the initiation of growth of Cryptococcus neoformans. J. Bacteriol. 82:430-435. 1961.-The observation that a strain of Cryptococcus neoformans failed to grow in a medium containing normal human serum led to an investigation of some of the physiological factors controlling initiation of growth by this fungus.The data presented show that the growth of C. neoformans is markedly inhibited in media with initial pH values slightly above neutrality. The growth of four strains of the fungus was completely suppressed in peptone broth at pH values above 8. The growth of two strains was partially inhibited at a pH of 7.3. Two other strains grew well at 7.3, but were partially inhibited at pH 7.5. The growth in media at pH values which partially inhibited multiplication was granular in appearance. Microscopically the granules were composed of clumps of yeast cells. The possibility is suggested that pH may exert a portion of its effect on the growth of C. neoformans by influencing those factors which affect the stability of the cells in suspension.At a temperature of 25 C, growth of the fungus was initiated in media with a pH which suppressed growth at a temperature of 37 C. Under the experimental conditions employed in these studies, proteose peptone no. 3 (Difco) serves as both a carbon and a nitrogen source. However, glucose, which is assimilated by C. neoformans in contrast to lactose, permitted the growth of the fungus at pH values which suppressed growth in the absence of the sugar.Since weakly buffered media, containing filtered, normal human serum, have an alkaline reaction higher than that shown to suppress the growth of C. neoformans, it was concluded that this factor was primarily responsible for the failure of the fungus to reproduce in tissue culture media. However, it is also possible to show that even under optimal pH conditions normal human serum exerts an anticryptococcal effect. This activity of human serum was relatively heat-stable and was expressed only in high concentrations of serum. Serum adsorbed with viable cells of C. neoformans also inhibited the growth of the fungus, but a partially purified globulin fraction of serum was not inhibitory.The data are discussed in relation to the work of other investigators.

### 6165701
### In vitro contraction of the pupillary sphincter by substance P and its stable analogs.
### The effects of substance P and substance P analogs have been studied quantitatively by use of an isolated preparation of bovine pupillary sphincter muscle. Substance P contracts the pupillary sphincter in a dose-dependent manner with a value for median effective dose (ED50) of 1.0 X 10(-6) M. The effects of substance P result from its interaction with a specific receptor in the pupillary sphincter. These results strengthen the view that substance P is involved in the oculopupillary reflex.

### 10049749
### Intergenic transcription occurs throughout the human IL-4/IL-13 gene cluster.
### Recent experiments have shown that the previously identified elements in the proximal promoter of IL-4 are not sufficient to fully explain the regulation of its transcription. Consequently we examined another aspect of transcriptional regulation, intergenic transcription, which has been observed throughout the prototypic gene cluster of human beta-globin. These intergenic transcripts are nuclear and it is possible that they play an important functional role in the beta-globin locus. Here we show that intergenic transcription also occurs in the IL-4/IL-13 gene cluster. Intergenic transcription occurs when the surrounding genes are not transcriptionally active; it also occurs in the promoters of these genes; the transcripts are polyadenylated and they remain in the nucleus. We also show that, in HeLa cells which do not express IL-4 or IL-13, intergenic transcription is absent from the region immediately surrounding the genes. This suggests a role for intergenic transcription in the regulation of the IL-4/IL-13 gene cluster.

### 7164029
### Heparin treatment of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated with an experimental tumour.
### In rats bearing the solid Walker 256 carcinosarcoma microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MHA) developed during the course of tumour growth. A phase of hypercoagulability was followed by a significant decrease in plasma fibrinogen, platelet count and antithrombin III. A diminished haematocrit and a rise in plasma haemoglobin and schistocyte count were accompanied by fibrin deposits in the tumour vessels. When the rats were treated with heparin during the growth of the Walker tumour, both DIC and MHA were prevented except of the last period of the experiment. The tumour sizes, however, did not differ in the controls and the heparinized animals. There is a fair amount of evidence to suggest that the MHA was induced by a tumour-dependent DIC which was blocked by heparin over a certain time period. In contrast, the tumour growth was not modified by effective suppression of DIC and MHA.

### Serotonergic modulation of anticholinergic effects on cognition and behavior in elderly humans.
### Cholinergic neurotransmission is thought to be modulated by serotonin as documented in animal and human studies. We examined the effects of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (0.4 mg IV) given alone or together with the serotonin mixed agonist/antagonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP, 0.08 mg/kg IV), and the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg IV). Ten normal elderly volunteers each received five separate pharmacologic challenges (placebo, ondansetron, scopolamine, scopolamine+ondansetron, and scopolamine+m-CPP). Cognitive, behavioral, and physiologic variables were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. The acute effects of scopolamine in certain cognitive, behavioral, and physiological measures were significantly exaggerated by the addition of m-CPP. Scopolamine's cognitive effects were unaffected by ondansetron at the dose tested, nor did ondansetron given alone affect basal cognitive performance. This pilot study suggests that the serotonin mixed agonist/antagonist m-CPP may influence cholinergic neurotransmission. The changes associated with the combination of scopolamine and m-CPP do not appear to be secondary to simple pharmacokinetic alterations and suggest a complex interaction between the cholinergic and serotonergic systems centrally.

### Prediction of death after percutaneous coronary interventional procedures.
### BACKGROUND: The prediction and comparison of procedural death after percutaneous coronary interventional procedures is inherently difficult because of variations in case mix and practice patterns. The impact of modern, expanded patient selection criteria, and newer technologic approaches is unknown. Our objective was to determine whether a risk equation based on patient-related variables and derived from an independent data set can accurately predict procedural death after percutaneous coronary intervention in the current era. METHODS AND RESULTS: An analysis was made of the Mayo Clinic Coronary Interventional Database January 1, 1995, to October 31, 1997. Expected mortality rate was calculated with the use of the New York State multivariate risk score. In 3387 patients, 3830 procedures (55.1% stents) were performed, with an expected mortality rate of 2.32% and observed mortality rate of 2.38% (P = not significant). The risk score derived from the New York multivariate model was highly predictive of death (chi-square = 213.8; P <.0001). The presence of a high-risk lesion characteristic such as calcium, thrombus, or type C lesion was modestly associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: The New York State multivariate model accurately predicted procedural death in our database.

### 11931372
### Forensic psychiatry and the internet: practical perspectives on sexual predators and obsessional harassers in cyberspace.
### The growth of the Internet has revolutionized how society conducts business in many areas. Not to be left behind, the sexual predator and the obsessional harasser have found cyberspace to be a vehicle capable of meeting their needs: obtaining information, monitoring and contacting victims, developing fantasy, overcoming inhibitions, avoiding apprehension, and communicating with other offenders. Although clearly disparate offender categories, these two groups are included in this article because of the likelihood of their using the Internet in pursuit of their goals. Forensic psychiatrists should become familiar with computers and the Internet so that they can conduct relevant psychiatric evaluations of such individuals and can advise attorneys, victims, and law enforcement personnel competently, when retained in that capacity. This article discusses the Internet and its use by the sexual predator and the obsessional harasser, highlighting information of interest to the forensic psychiatrist, including the poorly understood field of digital evidence. Aspects of the Internet, such as on-line dating and cybersex also are covered, because they relate to sexual predation and stalking.

### Quantitation of malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma, by ion-pairing reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography.
### An ion-pairing high performance liquid chromatography method is described for the separation and quantitation of malondialdehyde in plasma. The MDA is determined as the thiobarbiturate chromogen formed by reaction of the plasma with 2-thiobarbituric acid under acid and heating conditions. However, under these conditions other interfering chromogens can also be formed. Using DEAE-cellulose chromatography followed by ion-pairing HPLC, we have been able to separate and quantitate the levels of MDA-TBA chromogen formed in plasma from other interfering chromogens. Measurements of MDA levels in the plasma of six normal individuals by HPLC gives a mean value of 4.57 +/- 0.33 nmole/ml, whereas the spectrophotometric determined value is 8.83 +/- 1.15 nmole/ml. These data suggest that some reevaluation of the numerous papers published on MDA levels in plasma using spectrophotometric methods may be necessary.

### Gastric fundectomy in the rat: effects on mineral and bone metabolism, with emphasis on the gastrin-calcitonin-parathyroid hormone-vitamin D axis.
### In humans, gastric surgery results in in osteopenia via mechanisms that are insufficiently understood; surgery-induced changes in the hormonal axes involving the stomach, thyroid, and the parathyroids may play a role. To study this in more detail, we evaluated calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and phosphorus (P) metabolism as well as physical, chemical, and histomorphometric bone parameters in rats rendered hypergastrinemic by fundectomy (FX). In independent experiments, the response to an oral Ca challenge was investigated in intact rats versus FX, and in thyroidectomized versus thyroid-intact FX rats. Sixteen weeks following FX, body weight was approximately 80% that of sham-operated controls. In urine, P excretion was elevated fivefold, the pH was significantly decreased, and cAMP excretion was elevated as compared with controls; serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin, 25OHD, Ca, Mg, and P were normal; gastrin and 1,25(OH)2D were elevated. On the basis of bone ash mineral content, FX rats developed significant osteopenia, and histomorphometry indicated only slightly elevated bone turnover and mineralization. Following oral Ca, thyroid-intact FX rats developed hypercalcemia, serum gastrin decreased, and calcitonin increased significantly; in thyroidectomized FX rats, calcitonin remained at baseline levels although there was a similar degree of hypercalcemia; PTH decreased during the hypercalcemic period in both groups. Serum gastrin did not correlate with calcitonin or PTH, and in multivariate regression analysis the only predictor of serum 1, 25(OH)2D was urinary phosphorus. It was concluded that in the FX rat (1) osteopenia is not caused by intestinal Ca malabsorption, vitamin D, Ca deficiency, or secondary hyperparathyroidism; (2) osteopenia may be related to PTH-independent urinary hyperexcretion of P, followed by a rise of serum 1,25(OH)2D; (3) the existence of endocrine axes among gastrin, calcitonin, and PTH cannot be substantiated. FX osteopenia appears to be related to gastric acid abolition, and the reactive hypergastrinemia probably stabilizes the mass and turnover of bone.

### Neurobehavioral assessment of outcome following traumatic brain injury in rats: an evaluation of selected measures.
### Neurobehavioral assessment of outcome has played an integral part in traumatic brain injury (TBI) research. Given the fundamental role of neurobehavioral measurement, it is critical that the tasks used are of the highest psychometric quality. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate several, commonly used neurobehavioral measures along the dimensions of reliability, sensitivity, and validity. Using both the midline and lateral fluid-percussion injury models, nine neurobehavioral measures were evaluated that assessed three different neurobehavioral constructs. Reflex suppression was measured by the duration of the suppression of the pinna, corneal, and righting reflexes. Vestibulomotor function was assessed with the beam-balance, beam-walking, and rotorod tasks. Cognitive function was evaluated by three measures of Morris water maze performance (goal latency, path length, cumulative distance). The evaluation of the reliability of the nine neurobehavioral measures found that all had acceptably high reliability coefficients (0.79 or higher). The analysis of each measure's sensitivity to injury found that all measures were capable of detecting injury-induced impairments. However, there were some substantial differences in the sensitivity of the measures of vestibulomotor and maze performance: the rotorod was the most sensitive vestibulomotor measure and goal latency and path length were equally sensitive measures of maze performance. In the assessment of validity, the results of a factor analysis supported the convergent and discriminative validity of the measures. And in cases in which the preclinical and clinical research have assessed the same construct, the animal model neurobehavioral measures had predictive (or external) validity. Thus, according to the psychometric standards by which measurement instruments are evaluated, the results indicated that these measures provide a valid assessment of neurobehavioral function after fluid percussion TBI.

### 12193700
### CCR6 colocalizes with CD18 and enhances adhesion to activated endothelial cells in CCR6-transduced Jurkat T cells.
### CCR6 is expressed by memory T cells (mTC) and is a requirement for efficient arrest of a subset of mTC to activated human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) under physiologic shear stress. We now address whether CCR6 alone is sufficient to induce arrest of a model T cell line (Jurkat) that shows low expression of all CCRs tested (CCR1-10). Herein, we transduced Jurkat (JK) T cells expressing fucosyltransferase VII with a chimeric chemokine receptor consisting of CCR6 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein. In contrast to the starting JK lines, the resulting cell line (JK fucosyltransferase VII-CCR6) migrated 6-fold better to CCL20 in chemotaxis assays, arrested in response to CCL20 that was immobilized to plastic, and demonstrated a 2.5-fold increase in adhesion to activated HDMEC (p = 0.001). Adhesion was blocked by anti-CD18 mAb (p = 0.005) but not by anti-CD49d mAb (p = 0.3). After arrest on recombinant substrates, CCR6 clustered on the surface as detected by real-time observation of enhanced green fluorescent protein fluorescence. Dual-label confocal microscopy revealed that LFA-1 (CD18 and CD11a), but not CXCR4, colocalized with clustered CCR6 in the presence of immobilized CCL20. Thus, the functional expression of CCR6 is sufficient to provide the chemokine signaling necessary to induce arrest of a JK T cell line to activated HDMEC. Clustering of CCR6 and coassociation with critical integrins may serve to strengthen adhesion between T cells and activated endothelial cells.

### 8711467
### Gamma-ray activity and dose rate of brick samples from some areas of North West Frontier Province (NWFP), Pakistan.
### It is important to measure natural radioactivity due to gamma-rays from building materials and consequently to determine the dose rate from these materials. This helps to implement precautionary measures whenever the dose rate is found to be above the recommended limits. A knowledge of gamma radioactivity is required by the building construction association to adopt preventive measures to mitigate or minimize the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. The aim of this work was to measure the gamma activity due to 226Ra, 232Th and 40K in bricks from the Peshawar, Nowshera and Mardan districts of NWFP of Pakistan. The radiological doses to the occupants from the brick floor of a wooden house were calculated. The average gamma dose equivalent rate was calculated to be 0.14 mSv per year, which is well below the external gamma dose limit of 0.46 mSv per year as given in UNSCEAR [2].

### 356316
### The use of arterial--central venous oxygen differences to calculate cardiac output and oxygen consumption in critically ill surgical patients.
### Simultaneous determinations of cardiac output (using the cardiogreen indicator dilution technique) and arterial--central venous oxygen differences [C(a-cv)O2] were obtained in 200 critically ill surgical patients. The average initial values +/- SD included arterial--central venous oxygen differences of 3.6 +/- 1.6 vol%, cardiac index of 3.4 "/- 1.2 liter/min/sq m, and oxygen consumption of 100 ml/min/sqm. As might be expected, low arterial--central venous oxygen differences, especially if less than 2.0 vol%, were associated with high cardiac indices, but the oxygen consumptions were much lower than normal and the mortality rates were increased. The cardiac indices calculated from the C(a-cv)O2 averaged 4.1 liter/min/sq m and correlated rather well with the measured cardiac indices, particularly if the patients with a C(a-cv)O2 of less than 2.0 vol% were excluded. Arterial pH values did not correlate well with the calculated oxygen consumption. Arterial oxygen contents of more than 16.2 vol% equivalent to a hemoglobin of 12.5 gm/dl or higher with an oxygen saturation of 95%, provided better arteriovenous oxygen differences, oxygen consumptions, and survival rates than those found with lower hemoglobin values. Arterial--central venous oxygen differences and calculated oxygen consumptions can be practical clinical and prognostic value.

### [Neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors]
### Neuroendocrine tumors are an interesting group of neoplasmas of the digestive system. A possibility of appearance of syndromes connected with hormonal activity is their common feature. Some of them are not hormonally active and they do not manifest hormonal hyperactivity. The authors present 2 patients with malignant neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors in whom the lack of clinical syndromes connected with overproduction of hormone resulted in the establishment of the diagnosis in an advanced stage of the disease. The tumors were not clinically active but immunohistochemical examinations revealed the presence of hormones in cytoplasmatic granules. Both patients had positive immunostaining for VIP, NSE and chromogranin. Moreover, in one of the patients positive staining for ACTH and glucagon and in another for PGP 9.5 was obtained.

### 6099349
### Colour-spatial vision.
### A critical survey is made of neurophysiological and psychophysiological investigations of colour vision. A neuronal model of colour-spatial vision is suggested. The model allows a unified explanation of the whole range of psychophysiological phenomena: the mixing of colours of high-frequency image components, the McCollough type colour after-effects, the simultaneous and successive colour contrast, the hue constancy perception, the appearance of non-spectral colours by mixing of monochromatic lights. A suggestion is made as to the existence of two main mechanisms of colour vision. The first of these, by means of Fourier transforms, gives a set of coefficients which describes the spatial distribution of light (quantity of energy) and hue (quality of energy) in the visual field. The second mechanism establishes colour names in each chromatically homogenous area of the field described by the first mechanism. Both mechanisms cooperate on the basis of their common spatial organization.

### 193054
### Opiate receptor identification in vitro and in vivo.
### Using tritiated opiates with a high specific radioactivity, a high affinity binding to brain homogenates has been observed in vitro. Strong evidence was given that this type of binding is due to the interaction of labelled opiates with their specific receptors in the brain, since the ability of a wide variety of opiates to inhibit this binding corresponds very well with the potency of the drugs to produce their pharmacological effects in vivo. We have found that the simultaneous injection of labelled opiates into animals together with high doses of nonradioactive opiates decreases the brain concentration of the labelled drug. This displacement from brain satisfies criteria similar to those used for the identification of the opiate receptor in vitro. Furthermore, opiates produce their pharmacological effects in the same dose range in which they are able to displace a radiolabelled opiate from the brain. This strongly suggests that the receptor occupation by opiates can be identified by concentration changes in the brain of living animals.

### 17369240
### Genetic analysis of the twenty-one-day pregnancy rate in US Holsteins using an ordinal censored threshold model with unknown voluntary waiting period.
### Genetic variation in the number of 21-d opportunity periods required to achieve pregnancy after the voluntary waiting period (VWP) had passed was examined using 44,901 lactation records of 29,422 lactating Holstein cows on 61 large commercial dairy farms in the United States. Cows were allowed a maximum of 8 opportunity periods, and the cumulative percentages of cows that became pregnant by the end of the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth opportunity periods were 19, 29, 37, 43, and 47%, respectively. In addition, 38% of records were censored because of culling or failure to achieve pregnancy after 8 opportunity periods. Mean days open was 128 d for complete records, whereas mean days to last service was 148 d for censored records. An ordinal censored threshold model was developed, in which duration of the VWP was estimated simultaneously with prediction of sire breeding values. The posterior mean of intraherd-year heritability for the number of 21-d opportunity periods required to achieve pregnancy was 0.06, with a posterior standard deviation of 0.01. Posterior means for duration of the VWP ranged from 28 to 74 d postpartum among the 116 herd-parity classes represented in the study, whereas farmer-reported survey values for duration of the VWP ranged from 30 to 78 d postpartum. Sires' predicted transmitting abilities were computed, assuming an unknown VWP (i.e., estimated from the data), a VWP fixed at 60 d postpartum, or a VWP fixed at farmer survey values. Correlations among sire predicted transmitting abilities from different models were > or = 0.98, although some reranking occurred among top sires. In summary, the proposed model for genetic evaluation of female fertility can accommodate heterogeneity in duration of the VWP between herds, as well as heterogeneity that may arise within herds owing to management practices such as intentional delay of first insemination in high-producing cows or cows with poor body condition, and it can also accommodate censored records for nonpregnant cows.

### 15623460
### Determinants for urinary and plasma isoflavones in humans after soy intake.
### Consumption of soy foods leads to a biphasic appearance pattern of isoflavones (IFLs) in blood and urine, with peaks appearing at 1-2 h and 4-8 h after intake, but its causes are not understood. IFLs were measured repeatedly from plasma and/or urine after intake of soy foods, IFL glucosides, or aglycons without or with a mildly or radically reduced gut flora as a result of oral antibiotic (AB) treatment, or this combined with mechanical bowel preparation (AB+MBP). The typical biphasic IFL pattern in blood and/or urine was observed when a soy protein drink without (control) or with AB treatment or when IFL glucosides or aglycons were consumed. Soy intake combined with AB+MBP or consumption of puerarin led to a shift of the second peak to much later times. The first peak was absent after puerarin intake. Total urinary IFL recovery was more than 50% lower in the first 24 h, but overall 61% higher after AB+MBP vs. the control. When the area under the curves for corresponding time intervals were compared, individual or total urinary IFL excretion rates were highly correlated with individual or total plasma IFL levels (r=0.85-0.91; P <0.001). At the same urinary excretion rate three times more genistein than daidzein remained in the circulation. We conclude that urinary IFL excretion rates reflect circulating IFL levels, with daidzein appearing less in blood and more in urine than genistein. The first and second IFL peaks are due to uptake in the small and large intestine, respectively. The latter is the major locus of uptake (90%) at usual dietary IFL doses (0.15-1.5 mmol/kg body weight). A reduced gut flora delayed IFL uptake but led overall to increased urinary recovery because of less bacterial degradation in the intestine.

### Narrowing the critical regions for mouse t complex transmission ratio distortion factors by use of deletions.
### Previously a deletion in mouse chromosome 17, T(22H), was shown to behave like a t allele of the t complex distorter gene Tcd1, and this was attributed to deletion of this locus. Seven further deletions are studied here, with the aim of narrowing the critical region in which Tcd1 must lie. One deletion, T(30H), together with three others, T(31H), T(33H), and T(36H), which extended more proximally, caused male sterility when heterozygous with a complete t haplotype and also enhanced transmission ratio of the partial t haplotype t(6), and this was attributed to deletion of the Tcd1 locus. The deletions T(29H), T(32H), and T(34H) that extended less proximally than T(30H) permitted male fertility when opposite a complete t haplotype. These results enabled narrowing of the critical interval for Tcd1 to between the markers D17Mit164 and D17Leh48. In addition, T(29H) and T(32H) enhanced the transmission ratio of t(6), but significantly less so than T(30H). T(34H) had no effect on transmission ratio. These results could be explained by a new distorter located between the breakpoints of T(29H) and T(34H) (between T and D17Leh66E). It is suggested that the original distorter Tcd1 in fact consists of two loci: Tcd1a, lying between D17Mit164 and D17Leh48, and Tcd1b, lying between T and D17Leh66E.

### 8070200
### Growth plate matrix vesicle biogenesis. The role of intracellular calcium.
### Isolated bovine growth plate chondrocytes suspended in a synthetic cartilage buffer containing 10(-7) to 10(-3) M concentrations of calcium were treated with 1 microM ionomycin to induce changes in intracellular ionized calcium as measured by Fura-2 fluorescence. An increase in intracellular calcium of 10(-6) to 10(-4) M calcium resulted in the secretion of vesicles that contain alkaline phosphatase. An increase in intracellular calcium above 10(-4) M resulted in nonspecific cell fragmentation because of cell damage. Electron microscopy of the secreted vesicles demonstrated that their structure resembled matrix vesicles. Isolated cells treated with ionomycin (synthetic cartilage buffer with 10(-6) M calcium) demonstrated intact cell membranes, normal intracellular architecture, and numerous plasma membrane processes undergoing vesiculation. The plasma membrane of these isolated cells and the isolated vesicles demonstrated a positive stain for alkaline phosphatase. Fresh growth plate tissue demonstrated plasma membrane staining for alkaline phosphatase at the lower proliferative and upper hypertrophic cell zone, and an increasing number of alkaline phosphatase stained matrix vesicles in the matrix of the lower hypertrophic cell zone. The data indicate that an increase in intracellular calcium in the lower proliferative and hypertrophic cell zones of the growth plate induces the secretion of plasma membrane derived matrix vesicles.

### Evaluation of haplotypes associated with copper toxicosis in Bedlington Terriers in Australia.
### OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the haplotype distribution associated with the copper toxicosis gene and the segregation of the mutated allele in a Bedlington Terrier population in Australia. ANIMALS: 131 Bedlington Terriers. PROCEDURE: Samples of DNA and RNA were obtained from each dog. Genetic status of each dog was evaluated by use of the DNA markers C04107; single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which was adjacent to exon 2 of Murr1; and a deletion marker for exon 2. A subgroup of the study population was evaluated by use of biochemical and histologic techniques to elucidate the correlation between genotype and phenotype. RESULTS: We identified a recombination between the C04107 marker and Murr1 and a variation in a nucleotide in the splice site of exon 2 in our Bedlington Terrier cohort. Furthermore, we identified a novel haplotype associated with copper toxicosis in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our findings indicate that the deletion of exon 2 was not the sole cause of copper toxicosis, although only exon 2 deletion of Murr1 has been responsible for copper toxicosis in Bedlington Terriers. Although we failed to find a novel mutation in our cohort, we identified an affected dog family with an intact exon 2. Furthermore, we found that an SNP in the 5' splicing site of exon 2 may or may not be associated with a novel mutation of the Murr1 gene or other genes. Loss of linkage between the C04107 marker and the Murr1 gene was also identified in a certain family of dogs.

### 12463776
### Machine learning models for lung cancer classification using array comparative genomic hybridization.
### Array CGH is a recently introduced technology that measures changes in the gene copy number of hundreds of genes in a single experiment. The primary goal of this study was to develop machine learning models that classify non-small Lung Cancers according to histopathology types and to compare several machine learning methods in this learning task. DNA from tumors of 37 patients (21 squamous carcinomas, and 16 adenocarcinomas) were extracted and hybridized onto a 452 BAC clone array. The following algorithms were used: KNN, Decision Tree Induction, Support Vector Machines and Feed-Forward Neural Networks. Performance was measured via leave-one-out classification accuracy. The best multi-gene model found had a leave-one-out accuracy of 89.2%. Decision Trees performed poorer than the other methods in this learning task and dataset. We conclude that gene copy numbers as measured by array CGH are, collectively, an excellent indicator of histological subtype. Several interesting research directions are discussed.

### 8864460
### Successful treatment of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPS).
### Severe veno-occlusive (VOD) disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients, and new approaches in managing patients who develop serious VOD is needed. In this report, we describe a patient who underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPS) for life-threatening VOD are following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for AML. Although the patient died of CMV-associated pneumonitis 5 weeks later, the TIPS functioned well until her death and permitted regression of the hepatic and renal symptoms. This report suggests that TIPS may be feasible and effective for managing patients with life-threatening liver dysfunction after marrow transplantation.

### 12575786
### Management of traumatic abdominal wall hernia.
### Traumatic abdominal wall hernia (TAWH) can occur after blunt trauma and can be classified into low- or high-energy injuries. Low energy injuries occur after impact on a small blunt object. High-energy injuries are sustained during motor vehicle accidents or automobile versus pedestrian accidents. We present six cases of high-energy TAWH cases that were treated at our trauma center. All patients presented with varying degrees of abdominal tenderness with either abdominal skin ecchymosis or abrasions, which made physical examination difficult. CT scan confirmed the hernia in each patient. All six patients had associated injuries that required open repair. The abdominal wall defects were repaired primarily. Three patients (50%) in our series developed a postoperative wound infection or abscess. Review of the literature on low-energy TAWH shows no associated abdominal injuries. In conclusion distinction between low- and high-energy injury is imperative in the management of TAWH. Hernias following low-energy injuries can be repaired after local exploration through an incision overlying the defect. TAWHs following high-energy trauma should undergo exploratory laparotomy through a midline incision. The defect should be repaired primarily and prosthetics avoided because of the high incidence of postoperative infection.

### Neuro Talk an Interface for Multifunctional Neural Engineering ASICs.
### With the availability of modern application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design tools, simulation packages, and low-cost commercial silicon foundry processes, it is becoming increasingly easy for any laboratory, or small company, to develop a custom ASIC. For stimulation, as well as recording, chips that perform specialized functions can be designed, fabricated, and tested within a time period of 2-3 months. In many cases, the desired functionality can only be obtained by using VLSI design methods. Despite this increase in ASIC functionality, as related to neural engineering applications, there exists no common interface protocol for communicating with, and controlling, neural engineering ASICs. This would be analogous to each company that manufactures PC-based systems to have no common method of communication, e.g. USB, GBIB, RS-232, etc. While it might seem elusive, we propose the specification and development of a universal interface protocol for neural engineering ASICs. We have named this interface, NeuroTalktrade.

### 15549471
### A rabbit model for evaluation of surgical anesthesia and analgesia: characterization and validation with isoflurane anesthesia and fentanyl analgesia.
### PURPOSE: With a clamp test, quantitative estimation of the level of surgical anesthesia/analgesia is not easy. We have developed a rabbit pain model allowing for quantitative evaluation of the level of surgical anesthesia/analgesia using both electrical and mechanical stimuli as simulated surgical stimuli. We evaluated whether this model allows for accurate tracing of dynamically changing levels of surgical anesthesia/analgesia induced by isoflurane and fentanyl. METHODS: Eight rabbits tracheotomized and vascularly cannulated under 3% isoflurane anesthesia were placed on a sling that allowed for free movement of the head and extremities. After the isoflurane concentration was reduced stepwise to 1.5% and then to 0%, four graded doses of fentanyl (5, 10, 20, and 40 microg.kg(-1)) were injected intravenously at intervals of 120 min. At each dose, anesthetic/analgesic end-point variables were determined, including the number of animals behaviorally unresponsive to clamping the forepaw (nonresponders) and the threshold voltage of subcutaneous electrical stimulation (2, 5, and 50 Hz) required to evoke the head lift (HLT: pain detection/arousal threshold: sedative/hypnotic index) and the escape movement (EMT: pain tolerance threshold: analgesic index). RESULTS: With increasing doses of isoflurane and fentayl, HLTs and EMTs, especially those at 5 Hz, increased dose-dependently and proportionately to increases in the number of nonresponders to clamping the forepaw, a standard indicator of the anesthetic/analgesic level. CONCLUSION: Using the HLT and EMT, especially at 5 Hz, combined with a clamp test, this rabbit model allows for repeated, quantitative, and distinctive evaluation of the dynamically changing levels of both sedative/hypnotic and analgesic components of surgical anesthesia/analgesia.

### [Blood deficiency values of polyunsaturated fatty acids of phospholipids, vitamin E and glutathione peroxidase as possible risk factors in the onset and development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]
### Plasma levels of vitamin E (vit E) and polyunsatured fatty acids of phospholipids (PUFA-PL) as well as erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity are significantly lower (p less than 0.001) in patients HIV sero-positive (AIDS and ARC cases) both affected and not affected with seborrheic dermatitis and in 32% of HIV sero-negative intravenous drug abusers (IVDA, A subgroup) than in controls. The deficiency of PUFA-PL (mainly C20:3 n-6, C20:4 n-6 and C22:6 n-3) which is associated with a significant increase (p less than 0.001) of saturated palmitic and stearic acids and monounsaturated oleic acid, cannot be correlated to an active lipoperoxidative process. In fact the levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive materials (TBA-RM) are not increased in the plasma of HIV sero-positive patients and A subgroup of IVDA. It is likely that the reduction of PUFA-PL is due to an inhibition of hepatic microsomal desaturase enzymes (delta 6 desaturase, delta 5 desaturase, delta 4 desaturase) which are involved in both n-6 and n-3 pathways. Since IVDA represent, and not only in Italy, a major risk category for HIV infection, we suggest that reduced blood levels of vit E, GSH-Px and particularly PUFA-PL may be added to the list of risk factors favouring the onset and the development of AIDS.

### 12265649
### Sri Lanka [Population education in countries of the region].
### Increases in the educational level and allied factors such as late marriage have led to a decrease in the birth rate to 27.6/1000 in Sri Lanka.  The World Fertility Survey in 1975 revealed that the average number of children desired was only 2.4 although the average number per family was 3.9, indicating the need for population education especially at the school level.  Population education components were introduced to the junior secondary level, grades 6-9, in stages beginning in 1974 following institution of the Population Education In-School Project at the Curriculum Development Centre of the Ministry of Education.  Population components were introduced into language, mathematics, science, health science, and social studies curricula already being taught.  The longrange objectives of the program are to prepare future citizens who will be knowledgeable about the impact of population growth on the quality of life, and to promote responsible attitudes and decisions regarding family size.  Immediate objectives are to promote understanding of population dynamics and encourage responsible attitudes.  The program strives to avoid conflict with sociocultural and socioreligious norms of the various population sectors.  Teacher training was provided in residential seminars, and through course guides and reference books.  Reorganization of the educational structure led to a brief period of inactivity for the Population Education Unit, but work began again in 1980.  The Non-Formal Education Branch of the Ministry of Education is ragarded as a possible area for introduction of population education components in adult education.  Most population education programs directed toward adults are conducted by other ministries.  The main problems in implementation of the junior secondary level population education program have been initial training of teachers and provision of resource and reference materials; use of the mobile library donated by the UNESCO Population Education Clearinghouse is expected to help alleviate the latter problem.  An innovative method of inservice teacher training utilized by the program is the use of a network of master teachers as inservice advisors.

### 10073477
### Effects of cold exposure on estrous behavior and neural estrogen receptor in Syrian hamsters.
### Two experiments examined the effects of 72-h exposure to reduced environmental temperature (5 degrees C) on steroid-induced estrous behavior and neural estrogen-receptor immunoreactivity (ERIR) in ovariectomized Syrian hamsters. Cold exposure significantly inhibited sexual receptivity induced by sequential injections of estradiol benzoate (2.5 microg) and progesterone (500 microg), but only if the animals were not permitted to overeat (limited to 110% of ad lib intake at 22 degrees C). The suppression of sexual receptivity was accompanied by decreases in the number of detectable ERIR cells in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and by increases in the number of ERIR cells in the medial preoptic area (mPOA). The cold-induced decreases in estrous behavior and in VMH ERIR cells were prevented by lesions of the area postrema (AP), but AP lesions did not prevent the increases in mPOA ERIR cells. Thus, cold exposure mimics the effects of treatment with metabolic inhibitors, experimental diabetes, food deprivation, and insulin-induced fattening on these endpoints. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dwelling in the cold affects reproduction indirectly via its actions on metabolic fuel availability, rather than by acting directly on neuroendocrine processes.

### Immediate breast reconstruction for stage III breast cancer using transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap.
### BACKGROUND: The management of state III breast cancer is challenging; it often includes multimodal treatment with systemic therapy and/or radiation therapy and surgery. Immediate breast reconstruction has not traditionally been performed in these patients. We review the results of immediate transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap in 21 patients treated for stage III breast cancer. METHODS: Data have been collected retrospectively on 21 patients diagnosed with stage III breast cancer between 1987 and 1994. All patients had mastectomy and immediate TRAM reconstruction. Thirteen patients received primary systemic therapy, 10 patients received postoperative consolidation radiotherapy to the operative site, and 3 patients received preoperative radiation. RESULTS: Mean follow-up for the group was 26 months. Two patients died with disseminated disease: neither of them developed local disease recurrence in the operative site; 82% of the patients followed for at least two years are free of disease. Sixty-two percent of the patients received preoperative chemotherapy, the remaining patients received postoperative multiagent chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Two of the patients received autologous bone marrow transplants after their adjuvant therapy. Ten patients had postoperative radiotherapy for consolidation; three patients received preoperative radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate TRAM reconstruction for stage III breast cancer is not associated with a delay in adjuvant therapy or an increased risk of local relapse. It facilitates wide resection of involved skin without skin grafting. Radiation therapy can be delivered to the reconstructed breast when indicated without difficulty. Breast reconstruction facilitates surgical resection of stage III breast cancer with primary closure and should be considered if the patient desires immediate breast reconstruction.

### Estrogen receptor knock-out mice: molecular and endocrine phenotypes.
### Using gene-targeting techniques, transgenic, knock-out (KO) mice, homozygous for the disrupted estrogen receptor alpha (alpha ERKO) and beta gene (beta ERKO) have been produced. Estrogen receptor (ER) beta expression does not appear to be dependent on ER alpha expression. Progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA is detected in alpha ERKO mice and appears to have both estrogen-independent and -dependent gene regulation. The phenotypic differences in alpha ERKO and beta ERKO mice are described. Additional studies will further define the specific roles of ER alpha and ER beta in various tissues.

### 15935605
### Chemiluminometric determination of propranolol in an automated multicommutated flow system.
### In this work, a fully automated analytical methodology for the chemiluminometric determination of propranolol hydrochloride in pharmaceutical preparations is proposed. The developed procedure was based on the oxidation of propranolol by potassium permanganate in acidic medium and was implemented in a multicommutated flow system. The combined automated actuation of syringe pumps and two-way solenoid valves, under computer control, assured a high versatility in terms of sample and reagent manipulation and an effective run-time control of all analytical parameters, including a time-based insertion that enabled a significant solutions saving and the exploitation of different strategies for sample/reagent mixing. The calibration graph was linear over the range 20-150 mg l(-1) of propranolol hydrochloride with a relative standard deviation lower than 1.6% (n = 7). The results were in agreement with those obtained by the reference procedure with a relative deviation between -3.8 and 3.7% and a sampling rate of about 27 samples h(-1).

### 3802551
### An open-labelled study of the safety, acute metabolic activity and pharmacokinetic profile of a short-term course of recombinant human growth hormone in healthy volunteers.
### The safety and short-term biological effects of recombinant human GH (Genotropin, KmbiVitrum AB, Stockholm, Sweden), given i.m. (8 IU/d) for 4 consecutive days to 10 healthy male volunteers, have been evaluated. No adverse reactions were detected by clinical investigation. Haematological parameters, clinical chemistry and the acute phase inflammatory profile showed no negative effects of the drug. The well-known metabolic effects of GH were seen as an increase in free fatty acids and in the somatomedin level (IGF-1). No antibodies to GH or periplasmic Escherichia coli peptides developed during the first month after treatment. The peak plasma level of hGH (62 +/- 20 mU/l) occurred between 3.0 and 3.5 h. This study shows that recombinant hGH induces no toxic or other adverse reactions and that the acute metabolic effects and the pharmacokinetic profiles are comparable to those reported after injections of GH extracted from pituitary glands.

### 11720634
### Medical treatment of silent myocardial ischemia.
### The pathophysiology of silent ischemia remains unclear, but it is extremely prevalent in patients with coronary artery disease. Stress testing is the preferred method of detection, but Holter monitoring is reliable in recording ischemia during daily life and in evaluating therapy. Prognosis is adversely affected by silent ischemia, whether the patient is symptomatic or asymptomatic. A variety of pharmacologic agents can reduce the ischemic burden, and data suggest that such therapy improves prognosis, although not as much as coronary artery revascularization.

### Nonarticular proximal tibia fractures: treatment options and decision making.
### Nonarticular proximal-third fractures account for 5% to 11% of tibial shaft injuries and occur as a result of a variety of mechanisms. Treatment is more challenging than for more distal fractures, and the rates of compartment syndrome and arterial injury are higher, especially for displaced fractures. Closed management often leads to varus malunion, especially when the fibula is intact. Closed treatment should therefore be reserved for nondisplaced or minimally displaced fractures with little soft-tissue injury. Plating of the proximal tibia has become a less popular alternative because of the high incidence of infection and fixation failure. However, judicious use of lateral plates as an adjunct to medial external fixation in comminuted fractures can be effective. External fixation remains the most versatile method. It is indicated for fractures with short proximal fragments and in cases of extensive soft-tissue injury that would preclude use of other surgical techniques. Temporary joint-spanning external fixation has a role in the initial management of certain fracture patterns, particularly when accompanied by severe soft-tissue injury. Although intramedullary nailing can lead to valgus malunion in a sizable percentage of patients with this injury, it can be useful for stabilizing fractures with proximal fragments longer than 5 to 6 cm. Placing the entry portal more proximal and lateral, locking in extension, and using specific techniques, such as blocking screws, can improve alignment after nailing. Use of an algorithm that takes into account the severity of soft-tissue injury, the length of the fracture fragment, and the degree of fracture stability allows effective decision making among current treatment techniques.

### 14722256
### Quantitative effects on c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase signaling determine synergistic interaction of cisplatin and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin in colon cancer cell lines.
### We investigated the effects of cisplatin and the hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in combination in a panel of human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines that differ in their p53 and mismatch repair status. Analysis of cytotoxicity after combined treatment revealed additive effects of cisplatin and 17-AAG in the HCT 116, DLD1, and SW480 cell lines and antagonism in HT-29 cells. Clonogenic assays demonstrated antagonism in HT-29, an additive effect in SW480, and synergism in HCT 116 and DLD1 cell lines. Analysis of signaling pathways revealed that cisplatin-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was fully blocked by 17-AAG in HT-29 and SW480 cells, whereas in HCT 116 and DLD1 cells it was inhibited only partially. The activation of caspases was also more pronounced in DLD1 and HCT 116 cell lines. These data suggested that a minimal level of apoptotic signaling through JNK was required for synergism with this combination. To test this hypothesis, we used the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125; when JNK was inhibited pharmacologically in HCT 116 and DLD1 cells, they demonstrated increased survival in clonogenic assays. Alternatively, sustained activation of JNK pathway led to an increase of the cytotoxicity of the cisplatin/17-AAG combination in HT-29 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the synergistic interaction of this combination in colon cancer cell lines depends on the effect exerted by 17-AAG on cisplatin-induced signaling through JNK and associated pathways leading to cell death. An implication of that finding is that quantitative effects of signaling inhibitors may be critical for their ability to reverse cisplatin resistance.

### 11285279
### Cyclin A is destroyed in prometaphase and can delay chromosome alignment and anaphase.
### Mitosis is controlled by the specific and timely degradation of key regulatory proteins, notably the mitotic cyclins that bind and activate the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). In animal cells, cyclin A is always degraded before cyclin B, but the exact timing and the mechanism underlying this are not known. Here we use live cell imaging to show that cyclin A begins to be degraded just after nuclear envelope breakdown. This degradation requires the 26S proteasome, but is not affected by the spindle checkpoint. Neither deletion of its destruction box nor disrupting Cdk binding prevents cyclin A proteolysis, but Cdk binding is necessary for degradation at the correct time. We also show that increasing the levels of cyclin A delays chromosome alignment and sister chromatid segregation. This delay depends on the proteolysis of cyclin A and is not caused by a lag in the bipolar attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, nor is it mediated via the spindle checkpoint. Thus, proteolysis that is not under the control of the spindle checkpoint is required for chromosome alignment and anaphase.

### Kinematic representation of imposed forearm movements by pericruciate neurons (areas 4 and 3a) in the awake cat.
### In eight awake cats, elbow flexion movements were imposed by a computer-controlled torque motor using three different classes of angular displacement inputs: force step-load displacements; sinusoidal displacements; and constant-velocity ramp displacements. Microelectrode recordings were obtained from 309 pericruciate neurons in areas 4 and 3a. Average response histograms for single-unit activity coupled with computer simulation of the imposed movements have shown in a neuronal population (n = 81), selected for receptive fields that were directly related to elbow movements, that both the magnitude and temporal features of the responses can be characterized by the coefficients of a third-order differential equation describing the movement's angular kinematics (i.e., position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk). To compare the responses of different neurons the coefficients were normalized to the angular velocity coefficient, which was assigned a weighted value of 1.0. The neurons' average responses were "predictable" by the normalized coefficients regardless of the imposed movements' temporal characteristics. Two distinct and spatially separate pericruciate areas containing neurons that responded to the imposed forearm movements were located: 1) one within area 4 at the lateral extent of the cruciate sulcus, which contained neurons that responded with predominant jerk and acceleration coefficients, exhibited either cutaneous or deep receptive fields, and demonstrated low microstimulation current thresholds to activate forelimb muscles; 2) a second, more laterally located area near the 3a/4 border in the postsygmoid gyrus, which contained neurons that responded with predominant velocity coefficients, and comparatively small jerk acceleration, and position coefficients, exhibited either cutaneous or deep receptive fields, and demonstrated high microstimulation thresholds (greater than 20 microA). Due to the sensitivity of the higher derivatives to changes in motion, the relative magnitude and time course of the average firing probability of area 4 neurons with prominent acceleration and jerk coefficients were dominated by these kinematic features during the more rapidly imposed movements. The findings are in accord with a hypothesis proposing that motor cortical neurons in area 4 form a sufficient substrate for a "predictive" feedback organization, and may constitute an essential component of a system capable of regulating errors in angular joint movements despite the relatively long conduction delays and the slow time course of muscle tension production inherent to mammalian neuromuscular systems.

### 2103765
### [Colorectal cancer: retrospective analysis of 762 cases]
### A study carried out during 1976-1988 on patients with colorectal cancer revealed an increase in the incidence of this disease of 150%, with a sex ratio of 1:1.17, there being a slight predominance in males. In the patients studied, 3.41% were older than 40. In patients in the 60-70 age group, 63.4% of the cases were diagnosed. The most frequent location of the tumor is the rectum (24.4%) and the least frequent (1.57% and 1.04%, respectively) in the hepatic and splenic angles. This was observed in all the years comprising the study. Adenocarcinoma was the commonest type of tumor, there being a highly significant association (p less than 0.001) between the histological type of cancer and the state of infiltration observed at the time of diagnosis.

### 10743356
### A toxoplasmic uveitis case of a 60-year-old male in Korea.
### A toxoplasmic uveitis case was reported on the focus of impairment of pathological findings and serological antibody titers after chemotherapy. A chief complaint of a 60-year-old male was a decreased and blurred vision in his right eye for 2 weeks after experiencing tremendous stress and fatigue. A steroid therapy for 3 weeks was not effective and the retinal lesion became necrotic. Anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibody titer was checked to be a strong positive by both ELISA and indirect latex agglutination assay (ILA). He was treated with Fansidar F for 8 weeks. His vision improved as the necrotic lesion healed by scarring, but the antibody titers still remained very high without any signs of negative conversion. It is suggested to be a recurrent case of the past asymptomatic infection by presumed immune suppression caused by excessive stress.

### 17478650
### Using focus groups in disability research.
### Qualitative health service research has increasingly drawn on focus groups to inform health policy and intervention design. Focus groups provide opportunities to engage in the development and evaluation of health services for those service users who are often excluded from other forms of data collection. Increasingly, people with disabilities have been recognized as a marginalized group in health research. To provide appropriate accommodation and to maximize the utility of focus groups with people who have disabilities, careful preparation and planning are necessary. In this article, the authors highlight critical issues in conducting focus groups with people who have various impairments and provide advice on what to consider in terms of preparation and analysis.

### 16019224
### Genetic variation of infant reduced folate carrier (A80G) and risk of orofacial defects and congenital heart defects in China.
### PURPOSE: This study was designed to investigate whether the risks of congenital heart defects (CHD) and orofacial defects were influenced by a polymorphism of the offspring's RFC1 or by an interaction between the RFC1 gene and maternal periconceptional use of folic acid. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted. A total of 82 families with a child affected by cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP), 67 families with a child-affected by CHD, and 100 nonmalformed control families were genotyped using PCR-RFLP. RFC1 G allele was tested through family-based association test. RESULTS: Among mothers who did not use folic acid, the risks of 4.03 (95% CI = 1.33-12.77) for the G80/G80 genotype and 4.14 (95% CI = 1.06-16.82) for the G80/A80 genotype were observed relative to the A80/A80 genotype for CHD offspring. In family-based association tests (FBAT), offspring carrying the G allele for RFC1 is at increased risk for CHD (Z = 2.140, p < .05). No significant association was found between either RFC1 genotype or maternal folic acid supplementation and the risks of CLP. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the RFC1 G allele is likely to be an important candidate gene in folate transport and to be associated with risk for CHD. This study found modest evidence for a gene-nutrient interaction between offspring RFC1 genotype and periconceptional intake of folic acid on the risk of congenital heart defects.

### 10188253
### Antiseptic susceptibility and distribution of antiseptic-resistance genes in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
### We examined the antiseptic susceptibilities and distribution of antiseptic-resistance genes qacA and smr in 98 isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus obtained in 1992. Seventy-one strains were resistant to antiseptics. The qacA and smr genes were detected in 10 and 20 strains, respectively. The remaining 41 strains without qacA and smr were divided into two groups that exhibited low-level (n = 22) and high-level (n = 19) resistance to acriflavin. DNA cloning and sequencing suggested that norfloxacin-resistance gene norA was responsible for the high-level resistance to acriflavin. Our results indicated that four or more antiseptic-resistance genes exist in methicillin-resistant S. aureus and that antiseptic-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains without qacA and smr are widely spread in Japan.

### 17973024
### Automatically detect and track infrared small targets with kernel Fukunaga-Koontz transform and Kalman prediction.
### Fukunaga-Koontz transform (FKT), stemming from principal component analysis (PCA), is used in many pattern recognition and image-processing fields. It cannot capture the higher-order statistical property of natural images, so its detection performance is not satisfying. PCA has been extended into kernel PCA in order to capture the higher-order statistics. However, thus far there have been no researchers who have definitely proposed kernel FKT (KFKT) and researched its detection performance. For accurately detecting potential small targets from infrared images, we first extend FKT into KFKT to capture the higher-order statistical properties of images. Then a framework based on Kalman prediction and KFKT, which can automatically detect and track small targets, is developed. Results of experiments show that KFKT outperforms FKT and the proposed framework is competent to automatically detect and track infrared point targets.

### 10800694
### Isoprenylation/methylation and transducin function.
### Freshly prepared proteolyzed (deprenylated) T beta gamma and material isolated from retina are inert with respect to activating T alpha in the presence of R* in detergent and in disk membranes. In addition, proteolyzed T beta gamma is also incapable of supporting the pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation of T alpha-GDP. These experiments show that isoprenylation/methylation is essential for the fruitful interactions between T alpha and T beta gamma at the membrane. When tested for its ability to support GTP-for-GDP exchange catalyzed by R*, demethylated T beta gamma proved to be approximately 50% as active as methylated T beta gamma in photoreceptor disk membranes (Fig. 3) and in reconstituted liposomes containing rhodopsin. In detergent, no difference was observed between methylated and demethylated T beta gamma, suggesting no role at all for the methyl group in functional interactions between T alpha, T beta gamma, and R*. The twofold activity difference observed in membranes can be accounted for by the twofold lessened affinity of the demethylated T beta gamma, compared with its methylated counterpart, for membranes in the presence of R* and T alpha. It is interesting to note that a substantially larger difference (> 10-fold) in the relative binding of methylated versus demethylated T beta gamma to membranes is observed in the absence of R* and T alpha. However, R* has a substantial affinity for T alpha beta gamma, and the influence of R* and T alpha greatly reduces any differences resulting from the presence or absence of a methyl group on T beta gamma. The results from studies of demethylated T beta gamma demonstrate that specific lipid-receptor interactions are unlikely to play a critical role in the rhodopsin-transducin system, and further show that the effect of methylation is probably due to the increased hydrophobicity of methylated T beta gamma versus its unmethylated counterpart. These studies are, of course, relevant to heterotrimeric G proteins, and specifically to the interactions of receptor (R*) with T alpha and T beta gamma. If a hydrophobic lipid-lipid mechanism is operative, the state of methylation would be expected to have a more profound effect on the membrane-associative properties of farnesylated proteins, but not on those of geranylgeranylated proteins. The increased hydrophobicity of the C20 geranylgeranyl group relative to the C15 farnesyl group will compensate for the loss of the methyl substituent. The results obtained in the transducin-rhodopsin system can be contrasted with the effect of gamma-subunit methylation on effector enzyme activation. In the case of the geranylgeranylated beta 1 gamma 2, methylation proved to have only a small effect on PIPLC beta activation (Fig. 4B). An approximately 25% diminution in efficacy, but not potency, was observed for the demethylated geranylgeranylated beta 1 gamma 2 versus its methylated counterpart. This again shows that specific lipid-protein interactions are unimportant. The effect of methylation on membrane binding would be expected to be small, given that beta 1 gamma 2 is geranylgeranylated. It is of interest to compare these results with those found with methylated and unmethylated T beta gamma as activators of PIPLC beta. In this instance there was a large effect noted, with methylated T beta gamma being at least 10-fold more potent than its unmethylated counterpart with respect to activating either enzyme (Fig. 4A). This result is readily understandable in light of the role of methylation in selectively enhancing hydrophobicity of farnesylated proteins as opposed to geranyl-geranylated proteins. Similar results were obtained for the activation of PI3K, further strengthening the conclusion that it is lipid-lipid interactions that direct beta gamma subunit membrane association.
